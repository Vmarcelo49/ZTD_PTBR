==== 5591 ====
This is...\\
==== 5592 ====
The Rec Room.\\
==== 5593 ====
It's the new year...?\\
==== 5594 ====
The vote was at 13:30, so we slept for over\\
ten and a half hours.\\
==== 5595 ====
Well, not necessarily.\\
==== 5596 ====
Right. Zero explained it earlier.\\
==== 5597 ====
Once ninety minutes are up, an injector in\\
your bracelet will activate.\\
==== 5598 ====
An anesthetic and an agent to erase your\\
memories will be administered.\\
==== 5599 ====
As a result, you'll all fall into a deep,\\
uninterrupted sleep.\\
==== 5600 ====
You will also forget everything that occurred\\
in those past ninety minutes.\\
==== 5601 ====
We might've just forgotten we did.\\
==== 5602 ====
So we've woken up a bunch of times already?\\
==== 5603 ====
Something horrible could've happened, and\\
we don't remember it...\\
==== 5604 ====
I can't even think about it without getting\\
chills.\\
==== 5605 ====
No good. It's locked.\\
==== 5606 ====
So it's like usual, and we're trapped?\\
==== 5607 ====
How about a drink to pass time, then?\\
==== 5608 ====
There's a lot of things we can do here.\\
==== 5609 ====
Uh, Junpei, in ninety minutes we'll–\\
==== 5610 ====
I'm kidding.\\
==== 5611 ====
Um, when you said "drink," did you–\\
==== 5612 ====
Well, we are 22 you know.\\
==== 5613 ====
I'm no longer that little boy who played Old\\
Maid with you years ago.\\
==== 5614 ====
Is that so...?\\
==== 5615 ====
True, looks, tastes, and other superficial\\
things change with time.\\
==== 5616 ====
But there must be something inside you that's\\
still the same.\\
==== 5617 ====
Swimming, going to festivals, getting into\\
snowball fights in the schoolyard...\\
==== 5618 ====
During the incident with the rabbits, you\\
protected me, didn't you?\\
==== 5619 ====
What about it...?\\
==== 5620 ====
The Junpei from back then... He must be\\
somewhere...\\
==== 5621 ====
Says the one of us who changed first.\\
==== 5622 ====
No.\\
==== 5623 ====
You might not have changed at all, it's just\\
me seeing things I missed before.\\
==== 5624 ====
Let me tell you something, Junpei.\\
==== 5625 ====
Say what you need to, while there's time to\\
say it.\\
==== 5626 ====
Carlos...\\
==== 5627 ====
The hell...\\
==== 5628 ====
You make it sound like I'm some brat who lies\\
to himself.\\
==== 5629 ====
Once, I couldn't save my parents because of\\
my inexperience.\\
==== 5630 ====
You?\\
==== 5631 ====
Wait, you weren't a firefighter then?\\
==== 5632 ====
I was 18, and had only just passed the test–\\
==== 5633 ====
I'd come home after buying a birthday\\
present for my sister...\\
==== 5634 ====
At that point, I had arrived before the fire\\
department had.\\
==== 5635 ====
That's why I...\\
==== 5636 ====
Carlos, I'm here!\\
==== 5637 ====
I'm over here!\\
==== 5638 ====
I managed to save my sister, but not my\\
mother and father.\\
==== 5639 ====
It was because of their support that I could\\
become a firefighter.\\
==== 5640 ====
And I was never able to even thank them...\\
==== 5641 ====
Ah, sorry.\\
==== 5642 ====
I kinda brought the mood down.\\
==== 5643 ====
Anyway, I just wanted to say...\\
==== 5644 ====
I don't want the two of you to end up having\\
any regrets.\\
==== 5645 ====
If you have something to say, say it while\\
you're alive.\\
==== 5646 ====
While we're alive...\\
==== 5647 ====
Please don't say that. It's bad luck...\\
==== 5648 ====
Heh. Good point.\\
==== 5649 ====
Okay, let's find a way out of here.\\
==== 5650 ====
That is the first step to staying alive.\\
==== 5651 ====
The rules to the Decision Game...will now be\\
explained.\\
==== 5652 ====
The Decision Game...\\
==== 5653 ====
Rules?!\\
==== 5654 ====
This Decision Game utilizes the three\\
dice...located during the room search.\\
==== 5655 ====
So these, then...\\
==== 5656 ====
To begin this game, each player must take one\\
die and roll them together on the dice table.\\
==== 5657 ====
If all dice show a "1" on the side facing up...all\\
players win.\\
==== 5658 ====
The door will then unlock...and all the players\\
will be able to escape the room.\\
==== 5659 ====
However...if even a single die does not\\
display a "1"...\\
==== 5660 ====
Everyone in the room will be gunned down.\\
==== 5661 ====
What... Oh my God, what the hell is this shit?!\\
==== 5662 ====
This isn't even a fucking game!\\
==== 5663 ====
There's no tactics or strategy or anything!\\
==== 5664 ====
The time limit is...one minute.\\
==== 5665 ====
If all of the dice are not rolled...within that\\
time limit...\\
==== 5666 ====
Everyone will be gunned down.\\
==== 5667 ====
Those are all the rules.\\
==== 5668 ====
Good luck...to everyone.\\
==== 5669 ====
What're the odds?\\
==== 5670 ====
Huh?\\
==== 5671 ====
The odds we'll get all the dice to roll a 1!\\
==== 5672 ====
Oh, umm... It's 1/216, so...\\
==== 5673 ====
About 0.46%!\\
==== 5674 ====
0.46...?!\\
==== 5675 ====
Gatling guns operational in...thirty seconds.\\
==== 5676 ====
Shit, there's no time!\\
==== 5677 ====
Just roll them!\\
==== 5678 ====
Goddammit! I can't die here!\\
==== 5679 ====
There's still...something I need to say...\\
==== 5680 ====
...Huh?\\
==== 5681 ====
10... 9...\\
==== 5682 ====
Okay then, here we go!\\
==== 5683 ====
Come on!\\
==== 5684 ====
Pray hard! If we pray, then it's gotta–!\\
==== 5685 ====
Huh...?\\
==== 5686 ====
No way...\\
==== 5687 ====
Aww, yes yes! Hell yeeaah!\\
==== 5688 ====
We're alive! We're actually alive!\\
==== 5689 ====
Yeeeaaahh!\\
==== 5690 ====
Hey, why are the two of you just standing\\
there?!\\
==== 5691 ====
Guys, it's 1/216!\\
==== 5692 ====
We just got a miracle!\\
==== 5693 ====
You can be a little happy!\\
==== 5694 ====
Y-Yeah... You're right...\\
==== 5695 ====
I just...can't believe it...\\
==== 5696 ====
We're...alive, right?\\
==== 5697 ====
Of course we're alive!\\
==== 5698 ====
What, do I look like a ghost to you?!\\
==== 5699 ====
Or an undead zombie?!\\
==== 5700 ====
If I was, then my heart wouldn't be pounding a\\
mile a minute right now!\\
==== 5701 ====
Come on, let's blow this popcicle stand!\\
==== 5702 ====
We definitely gotta have a toast back in the\\
Lounge!\\
==== 5703 ====
Come on! What're you doing?! Hurry up!\\
==== 5704 ====
I don't think I've seen Junpei this excited\\
since grade school.\\
==== 5705 ====
I guess he's still the same guy you knew\\
underneath, huh?\\
==== 5706 ====
I'm really glad...\\
==== 5707 ====
That we're alive? Or...\\
==== 5708 ====
Both...\\
==== 5710 ====
Nothing beats a cold one after surviving a\\
close call!\\
==== 5711 ====
Come on, you guys should join me.\\
==== 5712 ====
Sorry, I'll pass.\\
==== 5713 ====
I'm really not in the mood for it...\\
==== 5714 ====
For real?! Are you serious?!\\
==== 5715 ====
Hey, are you already drunk?\\
==== 5716 ====
Yeah, I am! Drunk on life!\\
==== 5717 ====
I'm buzzed on this kickass feeling of\\
surviving the impossible!\\
==== 5718 ====
You probably shouldn't drink too much,\\
Junpei...\\
==== 5719 ====
Why not?\\
==== 5720 ====
We're just going to conk out again in 40\\
minutes anyway, remember?\\
==== 5721 ====
We just experienced the miracle of hitting\\
1/216 odds! 0.46%! Guys, come on!\\
==== 5722 ====
Let's use the remaining time we have to\\
savor this awesome moment!\\
==== 5723 ====
A miracle, huh...?\\
==== 5724 ====
It definitely would be, if it happened on the\\
first try...\\
==== 5725 ====
Guys, what are you saying? We only threw the\\
dice once, right?\\
==== 5726 ====
Are you sure about that...?\\
==== 5727 ====
Maybe we just don't remember,\\
==== 5728 ====
and in reality we've rolled the dice over and\\
over again.\\
==== 5729 ====
...Huh?\\
==== 5730 ====
If we threw them three times, the probability\\
would be 72 to 1.\\
==== 5731 ====
I wouldn't really call those odds a "miracle."\\
==== 5732 ====
So what? Does that really matter?\\
==== 5733 ====
I'll say it again; we've only gone and thrown\\
the dice once. Once.\\
==== 5734 ====
Right, Carlos?\\
==== 5735 ====
Yeah, that's true...\\
==== 5736 ====
What are you trying to say, Akane?\\
==== 5737 ====
Carlos, let's say you were going to roll ten\\
dice all at the same time.\\
==== 5738 ====
So, do you think you'd end up with all of them\\
displaying a "1"?\\
==== 5739 ====
Of course not. That's impossible.\\
==== 5740 ====
Right.\\
==== 5741 ====
The probability is 60,466,176 to 1, but that's\\
essentially impossible.\\
==== 5742 ====
If you tried 60,466,176 times, however, what\\
would happen?\\
==== 5743 ====
The likelihood of all of them being 1 is...\\
==== 5744 ====
Not so much of an impossibility, right?\\
==== 5745 ====
I'll give you another example.\\
==== 5746 ====
Junpei.\\
==== 5747 ====
If 2 to the 4th power–16–people compete in a\\
rock, paper, scissors tournament,\\
==== 5748 ====
how many matches are needed before a\\
winner can be determined?\\
==== 5749 ====
Why're you talking about–\\
==== 5750 ====
Just answer the question.\\
==== 5752 ====
Uh, really? Okay, first the 16 narrow down to\\
8, then 8 to 4, and 4 to 2...\\
==== 5753 ====
After the final round, one person's left\\
standing, so...\\
==== 5754 ====
A total of 4?\\
==== 5755 ====
So, what would happen if 2 to the 100 did the\\
same thing?\\
==== 5756 ====
That's dumb. There aren't enough people on\\
the planet to–\\
==== 5757 ====
Then we'll call in all of the intelligent beings\\
living in outer space...\\
==== 5758 ====
Let's change it to that, then.\\
==== 5759 ====
Like this, the number of matches needed to\\
get a winner is...\\
==== 5760 ====
It'd be 100.\\
==== 5761 ====
And how confident do you feel about winning\\
this tournament, Junpei?\\
==== 5762 ====
I'm not, obviously.\\
==== 5763 ====
You're out of the competition after you lose\\
just one match.\\
==== 5764 ====
You'd have to win a hundred rounds straight\\
to win.\\
==== 5765 ====
But someone will do it and win, right?\\
==== 5766 ====
A victor who wins a hundred matches without\\
losing one will exist.\\
==== 5767 ====
Do you know what I'm trying to say?\\
==== 5768 ====
The person who won, won, but only because\\
of circumstance... I mean, more or less?\\
==== 5769 ====
Well duh, but why're you–\\
==== 5770 ====
It may be obvious, but it's important.\\
==== 5771 ====
"The one who lives on does so due to\\
circumstance."\\
==== 5772 ====
The anthropic principle...\\
==== 5773 ====
Oh, you've heard of it.\\
==== 5774 ====
Yeah, it's connected to the many-worlds and\\
multiverse theories...\\
==== 5775 ====
The hell are you...?\\
==== 5776 ====
This universe is a little too well-suited for\\
human beings.\\
==== 5777 ====
That principle explains why.\\
==== 5778 ====
They say, for example, that if Jupiter was\\
just a bit smaller,\\
==== 5779 ====
the Earth likely wouldn't have even formed.\\
==== 5780 ====
That's not the only instance either.\\
==== 5781 ====
There are physical constants throughout the\\
universe,\\
==== 5782 ====
but if even one had changed the tiniest bit,\\
humanity wouldn't have been created at all.\\
==== 5783 ====
But anyone can see we do actually exist.\\
==== 5784 ====
And that's exactly my point.\\
==== 5785 ====
We exist, therefore we know that we exist.\\
==== 5786 ====
Perhaps somewhere in reality there are\\
countless universes devoid of humanity,\\
==== 5787 ====
But it isn't possible to know if those other\\
universes exist or not.\\
==== 5788 ====
That's because there are no human beings to\\
observe within them.\\
==== 5789 ====
The only universe we can measure is our\\
own...\\
==== 5790 ====
Therefore this is the universe we exist in.\\
==== 5791 ====
Wait, are you talking about tautology?\\
==== 5792 ====
"1+1=2" is a form of tautology also, right?\\
==== 5793 ====
The left and right sides of the equation say\\
the same thing.\\
==== 5794 ====
That's sophistry.\\
==== 5795 ====
Are you sure...?\\
==== 5796 ====
Anyway, I get what you're trying to say,\\
Akane.\\
==== 5797 ====
Maybe somewhere in this world,\\
==== 5798 ====
there are an infinite number of histories\\
where we were executed by the gatling guns.\\
==== 5799 ====
But we don't know if those histories really\\
exist.\\
==== 5800 ====
Basically, because we're dead in those\\
histories.\\
==== 5801 ====
The dead can't observe the world.\\
==== 5802 ====
Only those who are still alive can do that...\\
==== 5803 ====
Therefore, we exist here. Now.\\
==== 5804 ====
The opposite of what I just explained could be\\
true as well.\\
==== 5805 ====
The universe could be not meant for\\
humanity.\\
==== 5806 ====
Maybe there's one not limited by gravity,\\
where they travel faster than light...\\
==== 5807 ====
You can't say for sure such a universe\\
doesn't exist.\\
==== 5808 ====
If it does, then we could expect that aliens\\
would be interacting together within it.\\
==== 5809 ====
Okay, now that sounds like fun.\\
==== 5810 ====
Maybe that was the universe God had\\
intended in the first place...\\
==== 5811 ====
And this one is a failure...\\
==== 5812 ====
So we exist in the universe God abandoned,\\
huh...?\\
==== 5813 ====
What's the matter?\\
==== 5814 ====
You guys talking like this... I don't feel like\\
drinking anymore.\\
==== 5815 ====
Kind of getting the feeling I was an idiot for\\
acting like we won the lottery.\\
==== 5816 ====
I mean, don't you agree?\\
==== 5817 ====
There could be a history somewhere out\\
there that's happier than ours right now.\\
==== 5818 ====
Then maybe it's really true...\\
==== 5819 ====
We might be in the history God abandoned.\\
==== 5820 ====
Now announcing...the current casualties...\\
==== 5821 ====
Q-Team: Q, Mira, Eric\\
==== 5822 ====
D-Team: Diana, Sigma\\
==== 5823 ====
These five are now deceased.\\
==== 5824 ====
As a result...five X-Passes...will be\\
revealed.\\
==== 5825 ====
EYE... KILL... FOOL... MOON... FATE...\\
==== 5826 ====
That is all.\\
==== 5827 ====
No...\\
==== 5828 ====
That means only Phi is still alive...\\
==== 5829 ====
Sorry.\\
==== 5830 ====
Forget what I just said.\\
==== 5831 ====
Seems like we're the ones with the best luck.\\
==== 5832 ====
God hasn't gone and abandoned us!\\
==== 5833 ====
What do you mean...?\\
==== 5834 ====
Didn't you hear that announcement?\\
==== 5835 ====
Five X-Passes were released.\\
==== 5836 ====
The only one left to die is Phi from D-Team,\\
and then–\\
==== 5837 ====
Junpei...\\
==== 5838 ====
Don't you ever say that. Even if it's a joke...\\
==== 5839 ====
What in the world were you thinking!\\
==== 5840 ====
What's your problem?\\
==== 5841 ====
Look. The three of us SHIFTed just fine, so\\
what's the big deal?\\
==== 5842 ====
It's not okay!\\
==== 5843 ====
Ah, we did get 7 X-Passes at least.\\
==== 5844 ====
Not you too, Carlos...\\
==== 5845 ====
I can't believe you!\\
==== 5846 ====
You always were like that, weren't you,\\
Junpei.\\
==== 5847 ====
When we were in 6th grade, you faced those\\
rabbit-killing middle school kids alone...\\
==== 5848 ====
There were probably other ways of handling\\
it, but you rushed right in.\\
==== 5849 ====
Even the SHIFTing. It's okay because it\\
worked, but what if I was left behind there...\\
==== 5850 ====
Well, I figured you could escape alone then...\\
Or something...\\
==== 5851 ====
But that way of thinking is completely wrong!\\
==== 5852 ====
Being the sole survivor does not make me\\
happy!\\
==== 5853 ====
There's no point in living once you lose the\\
one you care about the most!\\
==== 5854 ====
Akane...\\
==== 5856 ====
I'm sorry...\\
==== 5857 ====
I never meant to ever cause you pain like\\
that...\\
==== 5858 ====
What's that...?\\
==== 5859 ====
Well, remember back in elementary school\\
your dream was to wear a ring?\\
==== 5860 ====
On your left hand.\\
==== 5861 ====
So...\\
==== 5862 ====
What's the matter...?\\
==== 5863 ====
Junpei...\\
==== 5864 ====
Junpei...!\\
==== 5866 ====
Thank you...\\
==== 5867 ====
Thank you so much...\\
==== 5868 ====
But...\\
==== 5869 ====
You know this is my right hand, don't you?\\
==== 5870 ====
Wait, what...?\\
==== 5871 ====
Oh, you're right...\\
==== 5872 ====
It looked like the left from my side so...\\
==== 5873 ====
That's just like you, Junpei.\\
==== 5874 ====
Ah, well, we'll move it to the correct finger\\
later.\\
==== 5875 ====
I'll do it officially after we escape from\\
here...\\
==== 5876 ====
I understand.\\
==== 5877 ====
So, until then–\\
==== 5878 ====
I'll leave an empty spot open.\\
==== 5879 ====
It's been put on reserve.\\
==== 5880 ====
Akane, do you remember the X-Passes for\\
Junpei and me?\\
==== 5881 ====
Yes.\\
==== 5882 ====
Normally when someone SHIFTs they forget\\
the memories from the last timeline,\\
==== 5883 ====
but I'm used to it. It's all there.\\
==== 5884 ====
But wait, hold on. Carlos and I remember\\
what happened before too.\\
==== 5885 ====
I think the memories were strengthened due\\
to the resonance effect.\\
==== 5886 ====
Those with the ability to SHIFT– There are\\
three of us here, so...\\
==== 5887 ====
But I wonder why...?\\
==== 5888 ====
Why have three SHIFTers gathered in a place\\
like this?\\
==== 5889 ====
Doesn't really seem like a coincidence.\\
==== 5890 ====
True...\\
==== 5891 ====
Even if we really are seeing more SHIFTers in\\
the world, the probability–\\
==== 5892 ====
Wait.\\
==== 5893 ====
The numbers are increasing?\\
==== 5894 ====
Mankind is about to face an unprecedented\\
crisis.\\
==== 5895 ====
As it stands now, we'll lose six billion lives...\\
==== 5896 ====
I assume mankind has sensed that, and is\\
adapting...\\
==== 5897 ====
Even though it's, in reality, only a small\\
portion.\\
==== 5898 ====
There's no way there are tens of thousands\\
of SHIFTers.\\
==== 5899 ====
So...\\
==== 5900 ====
Then it's definitely on purpose.\\
==== 5901 ====
But we signed up for Dcom of our own free\\
will.\\
==== 5902 ====
But maybe we just think that, and in\\
actuality...\\
==== 5903 ====
We did exactly what Zero wanted?\\
==== 5904 ====
It's highly possible.\\
==== 5905 ====
Damn. What is that bastard thinking?\\
==== 5906 ====
Wasn't it because he needed us to SHIFT...?\\
==== 5907 ====
Why would that be important...?\\
==== 5908 ====
It'll all be over once we get out of here\\
anyway.\\
==== 5909 ====
You're right.\\
==== 5910 ====
We couldn't care less what Zero has planned\\
at this point.\\
==== 5911 ====
We need six X-Passes.\\
==== 5912 ====
We know five of them already, so...\\
==== 5913 ====
One more... Akane, tell us one of the other\\
X-Passes.\\
==== 5914 ====
It's "SAVE."\\
==== 5915 ====
Hey, what the hell...\\
==== 5916 ====
Wait, is the X-Pass wrong somehow...?\\
==== 5917 ====
That can't be...\\
==== 5918 ====
Let's try the other one, too.\\
==== 5919 ====
Akane!\\
==== 5920 ====
It's "DOLL."\\
==== 5921 ====
What the...\\
==== 5922 ====
No way...\\
==== 5923 ====
But why...\\
==== 5924 ====
X-Passes are set to...their respective\\
histories.\\
==== 5925 ====
X-Passes from alternate timelines...are not\\
applicable.\\
==== 5926 ====
Wh-What...?!\\
==== 5927 ====
No...\\
==== 5930 ====
Junpei...\\
==== 5931 ====
Now this is hilarious. How perfect!\\
==== 5932 ====
Why did we even struggle through all of that\\
just now?\\
==== 5933 ====
Those guns turned my body into Swiss\\
cheese,\\
==== 5934 ====
and you're telling me it was all for nothing...\\
==== 5935 ====
All we did was die in vain?!\\
==== 5936 ====
So, just one person needs to die...\\
==== 5937 ====
What...?\\
==== 5938 ====
Just one more person and Akane and Carlos\\
can...\\
==== 5939 ====
Junpei, you...\\
==== 5940 ====
Wait, Junpei!\\
==== 5941 ====
Hey!\\
==== 5943 ====
Junpei!\\
==== 5944 ====
You're...\\
==== 5945 ====
Penalty. Penalty.\\
==== 5946 ====
You are charged with a rule violation.\\
==== 5947 ====
That means you must be punished.\\
==== 5948 ====
Punished...?\\
==== 5949 ====
Time to exterminate.\\
==== 5950 ====
Exterminate...\\
==== 5953 ====
Akane!\\
==== 5954 ====
Dammit, he's so strong...\\
==== 5955 ====
Any more of those punches and...\\
==== 5956 ====
{Fi}This is...{Fn}\\
==== 5957 ====
E-Eric stop...\\
==== 5958 ====
Then tell us how to get this thing off!\\
==== 5959 ====
I... I don't–!\\
==== 5960 ====
A door...?!\\
==== 5961 ====
Maybe it's...\\
==== 5962 ====
Is this another exit...?!\\
==== 5963 ====
{Fi}Th-That was Q-Team...?!{Fn}\\
==== 5964 ====
{Fi}But how...{Fn}\\
==== 5965 ====
{Fi}How did I see Q-Team...{Fn}\\
==== 5966 ====
{Fi}It doesn't matter. I gotta do something...{Fn}\\
==== 5967 ====
{Fi}If I die now–{Fn}\\
==== 5968 ====
{Fi}Junpei–{Fn}\\
==== 5969 ====
{Fi}And Akane–{Fn}\\
==== 5970 ====
{Fi}Think, I gotta think!{Fn}\\
==== 5971 ====
{Fi}There must be a way...!{Fn}\\
==== 5972 ====
{Fi}Some way to survive this situation...{Fn}\\
==== 5973 ====
{Fi}There has to be...{Fn}\\
==== 5974 ====
I believe that what you just did was SHIFT,\\
Carlos.\\
==== 5975 ====
That's it! SHIFT!\\
==== 5976 ====
I could SHIFT...!\\
==== 5977 ====
{Fi}But there's no way I'm leaving Junpei and\\
Akane behind!{Fn}\\
==== 5978 ====
{Fi}I'll come up with a plan in another history and\\
jump right back...!{Fn}\\
==== 5979 ====
{Fi}But where do I go...?!{Fn}\\
==== 5980 ====
{Fi}Which history should I jump to?!{Fn}\\
==== 5981 ====
{Fi}Dammit, I don't have time to think.{Fn}\\
==== 5982 ====
{Fi}Then–!{Fn}\\
==== 5985 ====
You're fucking kidding me...\\
==== 5986 ====
What is this...\\
==== 5987 ====
Explanations can wait.\\
==== 5988 ====
We should get going before he starts moving.\\
==== 5989 ====
You say that...but where?\\
==== 5990 ====
That door.\\
==== 5991 ====
There's a device on the other side. It can get\\
us out of this mess.\\
==== 5992 ====
Let's go.\\
==== 5993 ====
Ah, I get it now.\\
==== 5994 ====
The three wards all overlapped each other.\\
Who knew.\\
==== 5995 ====
And I think I've figured out the transporter\\
more or less...\\
==== 5996 ====
So, where is our destination?\\
==== 5997 ====
Hmm...\\
==== 5998 ====
It appears as if you've finally arrived.\\
==== 5999 ====
Zero...\\
==== 6000 ====
You asshole! Where are you?!\\
==== 6001 ====
Let me make one thing clear for you.\\
==== 6002 ====
I no longer exist in this world.\\
==== 6003 ====
In the current history, I was executed by one\\
among you, your fellow teammate, Carlos.\\
==== 6004 ====
Wh-What...?!\\
==== 6005 ====
As such, I will be unable to answer any of your\\
questions.\\
==== 6006 ====
You are speaking to a recording.\\
==== 6007 ====
If you are desperate for answers, I suggest\\
finding me where I am alive.\\
==== 6008 ====
Unfortunately, in that history our positions\\
are reversed, and the three of you are dead.\\
==== 6009 ====
But if you do come, I will share vital\\
information.\\
==== 6010 ====
I'll be waiting to meet with you...\\
==== 6011 ====
The history when we died...?\\
==== 6012 ====
Damn it. Where is that?!\\
==== 6013 ====
Could it be...\\
==== 6014 ====
Damn it! Damn it!\\
==== 6015 ====
There's no way I'm dying here!\\
==== 6016 ====
Please don't...!\\
==== 6017 ====
Please!\\
==== 6019 ====
May you rest in peace.\\
==== 6020 ====
Desine fata deum flecti sperare precando.\\
==== 6021 ====
NOOOOOOO!\\
==== 6022 ====
I know.\\
==== 6023 ====
It's the one where we were executed.\\
==== 6024 ====
Wh-What...\\
==== 6025 ====
Hey, hold up.\\
==== 6026 ====
Then how the hell do we even jump to that\\
history?!\\
==== 6027 ====
We can't SHIFT there if our bodies are\\
already dead...\\
==== 6028 ====
Oh, so that's it! We're going to transport!\\
==== 6029 ====
If we pull this lever...\\
==== 6030 ====
He's...\\
==== 6031 ====
Penalty. Penalty.\\
==== 6032 ====
Time to exterminate.\\
==== 6033 ====
Go ahead Akane, Junpei!\\
==== 6034 ====
Huh...?!\\
==== 6035 ====
What are you saying?!\\
==== 6036 ====
It only works with one person in each! At\\
least that's what Diana told me!\\
==== 6037 ====
So no matter what, we can only transport two\\
people at once!\\
==== 6038 ====
So–!\\
==== 6039 ====
Hey, what are you guys doing?! Go now!\\
==== 6040 ====
But–!\\
==== 6041 ====
I'll definitely catch up with you!\\
==== 6042 ====
I promise! Trust me!\\
==== 6043 ====
After the transporter has been used once, it\\
won't work for a while.\\
==== 6044 ====
We'll hold you to it!\\
==== 6045 ====
I promise!\\
==== 6046 ====
I've never broken one before, and I won't\\
now!\\
==== 6047 ====
We're counting on you, Carlos!\\
==== 6048 ====
Are they gone...?\\
==== 6050 ====
{Fi}Oh man... This is bad...{Fn}\\
==== 6051 ====
{Fi}At this rate...{Fn}\\
==== 6052 ====
Don't give up on me, Carlos!\\
==== 6053 ====
Maria?! Is that you...?!\\
==== 6054 ====
I heard you calling out so I...\\
==== 6055 ====
Maria... Maria...!\\
==== 6056 ====
You know I'll be waiting for you...\\
==== 6057 ====
I'll never stop waiting...\\
==== 6058 ====
So...\\
==== 6059 ====
Yeah, you're right.\\
==== 6060 ====
There's no way I'm going to die here!\\
==== 6061 ====
I can't... I can't die here!\\
==== 6063 ====
Guess I can't use this thing anymore...\\
==== 6064 ====
Well, it wouldn't have worked for ten months\\
anyway, so it doesn't matter...\\
==== 6065 ====
What do I do now...?\\
==== 6066 ====
The place they transported to– How do I get\\
to the history where we were executed?\\
==== 6067 ====
It's as Junpei said: My body's dead there, so\\
I can't SHIFT...\\
==== 6068 ====
Wait a minute...\\
==== 6069 ====
Then...\\
==== 6070 ====
Dei firev neeb sahega madelos noc.\\
==== 6071 ====
Dereg girt noisolp xe.\\
==== 6072 ====
Wh-What the...?\\
==== 6073 ====
Uh, I don't understand, but...this doesn't look\\
good...\\
==== 6074 ====
No wait, this isn't bad!\\
==== 6075 ====
This is actually–\\
==== 6076 ====
It's my chance!\\
==== 6077 ====
Wait, wait wait wait wait. That one doesn't\\
count!\\
==== 6078 ====
Um, I...uh...\\
==== 6079 ====
Your hand slipped! That was it, right?!\\
==== 6080 ====
Yeah, what she said!\\
==== 6081 ====
You wouldn't mind a little do over right,\\
Zero–!\\
==== 6082 ====
Guess you're not the mulligan type...\\
==== 6083 ====
There! Get on the other side of the bar!\\
==== 6084 ====
Hurry!\\
==== 6087 ====
This should work...\\
==== 6091 ====
Now announcing...the current casualties...\\
==== 6092 ====
Q-Team: Q, Mira, Eric\\
==== 6093 ====
D-Team: Diana, Sigma\\
==== 6094 ====
C-Team: Carlos, Junpei, Akane\\
==== 6095 ====
These eight are now deceased.\\
==== 6096 ====
As as result...eight X-Passes will be\\
revealed.\\
==== 6097 ====
Wait, wait wait wait wait. That one doesn't\\
count!\\
==== 6098 ====
Um, I...uh...\\
==== 6099 ====
Your hand slipped! That was it, right?!\\
==== 6100 ====
Yeah, what she said!\\
==== 6101 ====
You wouldn't mind a little do over right,\\
Zero–!\\
==== 6102 ====
Did it work...?\\
==== 6103 ====
But this is...\\
==== 6104 ====
Hurry, Junpei! What was your idea?!\\
==== 6105 ====
Ah, right. First...\\
==== 6107 ====
What the hell...!\\
==== 6108 ====
Carlos, put Akane in the fireplace!\\
==== 6109 ====
Huh...?\\
==== 6110 ====
JUST DO IT!\\
==== 6111 ====
Junpei...what are you...\\
==== 6112 ====
Akane, listen to me.\\
==== 6113 ====
Carlos and I are going to be your shield wall.\\
==== 6114 ====
Wh-What...?!\\
==== 6115 ====
What are you talking about...?!\\
==== 6116 ====
The bullets shouldn't hit you if there are two\\
bodies in front of you.\\
==== 6117 ====
B-But if you do that, then you'll...!\\
==== 6118 ====
It's okay...\\
==== 6119 ====
Listen, Carlos and I will protect you\\
and...die.\\
==== 6120 ====
THE FUCK...?!\\
==== 6121 ====
Don't worry, it'll be fine.\\
==== 6122 ====
Before we die we just need to SHIFT to\\
another history.\\
==== 6123 ====
Once you hear all of the X-Passes, Akane,\\
you should follow right away–\\
==== 6124 ====
The X-Passes...?\\
==== 6125 ====
In this history, five are already dead. Phi's\\
the only other one alive.\\
==== 6126 ====
That means five X-Passes will be revealed.\\
==== 6127 ====
If Carlos's and mine are added to that...\\
==== 6128 ====
Then there'll be seven...\\
==== 6129 ====
No...\\
==== 6130 ====
Dammit Junpei, what the hell is this plan...!\\
==== 6131 ====
You're going to help, right?\\
==== 6132 ====
GOD DAMN IT!\\
==== 6133 ====
Please...don't do this.\\
==== 6134 ====
We can't go back now.\\
==== 6135 ====
This is the only way.\\
==== 6136 ====
Where are we jumping...?!\\
==== 6137 ====
To the history when we rolled the dice and\\
they were all 1's!\\
==== 6138 ====
Okay, let's do this then!\\
==== 6139 ====
Let's protect Akane no matter what!\\
==== 6140 ====
I'm counting on you, Carlos!\\
==== 6141 ====
No, no no no no no...!\\
==== 6144 ====
Now announcing...the current casualties...\\
==== 6145 ====
Q-Team: Q, Mira, Eric\\
==== 6146 ====
D-Team: Diana, Sigma\\
==== 6147 ====
C-Team: Carlos, Junpei\\
==== 6148 ====
These seven are now deceased.\\
==== 6149 ====
As a result...seven X-Passes...will be\\
revealed.\\
==== 6150 ====
EYE... KILL... FOOL... MOON... FATE...\\
SAVE... DOLL...\\
==== 6151 ====
That is all.\\
==== 6153 ====
Horrible...\\
==== 6154 ====
You're horrible, Junpei...\\
==== 6155 ====
Well, I should go now...\\
==== 6156 ====
To the history when all of our dice rolled a\\
"1"...\\
==== 6157 ====
No... NO...!\\
==== 6158 ====
Nooooooo!\\
==== 7860 ====
Damn it! Damn it!\\
==== 7861 ====
There's no way I'm dying here!\\
==== 7862 ====
Please don't...!\\
==== 7863 ====
Please!\\
==== 7865 ====
May you rest in peace.\\
==== 7866 ====
Desine fata deum flecti sperare precando.\\
==== 7869 ====
Wh-What's wrong, Carlos?\\
==== 7870 ====
Akane...\\
==== 7871 ====
So, it was a dream...?\\
==== 7872 ====
It must've been a pretty bad one...\\
==== 7873 ====
Though seeing where we are, I don't blame\\
you for having a nightmare...\\
==== 15786 ====
where the idea of humans didn't even begin.\\
==== 1010100 ====
A bar counter made of wood. There's\\
another one like this in the Lounge.\\
==== 1010101 ====
This all feels really adult. I like it.\\
==== 1010102 ====
No time for a drink right now. We have to\\
focus on getting out of this room.\\
==== 1010200 ====
This bar counter's pretty normal.\\
==== 1010300 ====
This is a small wooden box.\\
==== 1010301 ====
Maybe we can use it for something. Let's take\\
it with us.\\
==== 1010400 ====
Matches. They don’t feel wet, so we can still\\
use them.\\
==== 1010500 ====
AHHH! It's SUNSET 24!\\
==== 1010501 ====
And...why are you shouting, Junpei?\\
==== 1010502 ====
You don't know, Carlos?! They're super rare!\\
You can't find them anywhere anymore!\\
==== 1010503 ====
I memorized the slogan when I was a kid!\\
"The setting sun at 24. A perfect match."\\
==== 1010504 ====
Men... Always wanting to be cool. It's just a\\
cigarette.\\
==== 1010505 ====
Why do you have to be 24 to smoke it...?\\
Whatever, you said it's rare?\\
==== 1010600 ====
SUNSET 24. Apparently it's a rare brand of\\
cigarette.\\
==== 1010700 ====
It's a glass bottle of water.\\
==== 1010701 ====
Dramas on TV always have one of these\\
things as the murder weapon...\\
==== 1010800 ====
Wait! This is...!\\
==== 1010801 ====
SAD MAN 570... Is something special about\\
this wine, Carlos?\\
==== 1010802 ====
There's a legend about this bottle. You're\\
not supposed to ever drink it!\\
==== 1010803 ====
It's so bad, wine experts everywhere lose\\
their will to live after tasting it.\\
==== 1010804 ====
It's like Pandora's Box...but with wine.\\
==== 1010805 ====
It's all right if you open it, but please don't\\
drink it!\\
==== 1010900 ====
SAD MAN 570. I kind of want to try it...\\
==== 1011000 ====
Brandy, whiskey, sake... Man, this bar has\\
everything.\\
==== 1011001 ====
Are you a regular drinker, Carlos?\\
==== 1011002 ====
I've never bought for myself, but I don't\\
refuse when coworkers invite me out.\\
==== 1011003 ====
I always end up leaving early to visit my\\
sister though.\\
==== 1011004 ====
You really are dedicated to her.\\
==== 1011100 ====
Whiskey and brandy line the shelves. But\\
nothing catches my eye.\\
==== 1011200 ====
These are records?\\
==== 1011201 ====
Oh, really? I've never seen real ones before.\\
==== 1011202 ====
Me neither. I hear old bars sometimes still\\
use them though.\\
==== 1011203 ====
The player itself doesn't take up much space.\\
My parents used to have one.\\
==== 1011204 ====
When I listened to records on it, it made me\\
feel like I was really at a concert...\\
==== 1011300 ====
It's a shelf with a bunch of records. Nothing\\
strange here.\\
==== 1020100 ====
...\\
==== 1020101 ====
Why so serious, Junpei?\\
==== 1020102 ====
It's just...that tower of cards. My fingers are\\
itching to knock it down...\\
==== 1020103 ====
Same here. But it'd be a shame to destroy all\\
that hard work.\\
==== 1020200 ====
That tower is really distracting...\\
==== 1020300 ====
This tower... Let's knock it down.\\
==== 1020400 ====
Huh? Some of the cards are sticking to the\\
table?\\
==== 1020401 ====
They purposefully taunted us to topple the\\
cards so we'd see these.\\
==== 1020402 ====
There's a minus, a plus, and an equals sign...\\
Must be a math equation.\\
==== 1020500 ====
[A] [8] [3] - [10] [Q] [Q] [9] +\\
[9] [4] [Q] [5] [8] [J] =\\
==== 1020501 ====
These cards are set up to look like a math\\
equation.\\
==== 1020502 ====
You're right. And all the Kings are ripped in\\
half over to the side.\\
==== 1020600 ====
Hey, couldn't we just calculate this using the\\
numbers on the cards?\\
==== 1020601 ====
But the Queens and Jacks have no number.\\
And what about the ripped Kings?\\
==== 1020602 ====
There must be a clue to solve this around\\
here somewhere...\\
==== 1020700 ====
This card equation... Why would only the\\
Kings be ripped up?\\
==== 1020701 ====
The cards then only go up to Queen. Maybe\\
it's saying the numbers only go to 12?\\
==== 1020702 ====
Only to 12... Hmm.\\
==== 1020800 ====
The Kings are ripped so the highest card is\\
the Queen. So the numbers go to 12.\\
==== 1020801 ====
Only up to 12... Sort of like the months in a\\
calendar year?\\
==== 1020802 ====
Oh, you might be right! Didn't we just find a\\
calendar?\\
==== 1020900 ====
The first letter of each month is emphasized\\
on this calendar...\\
==== 1020901 ====
You're right. Maybe the card numbers match\\
the corresponding month.\\
==== 1020902 ====
Then the cards can form some kind of word!\\
==== 1021000 ====
The equation was the hint to the correct\\
number for the dice.\\
==== 1021100 ====
There are some square holes here.\\
==== 1021101 ====
Something could fit inside.\\
==== 1021200 ====
There are square holes in the table. Maybe we\\
can fit something inside them.\\
==== 1021300 ====
You know, I think the dice will fit here. Let's\\
find out.\\
==== 1021400 ====
These dice fit perfectly, but nothing's\\
happening.\\
==== 1021401 ====
It shows three digits, so maybe it's like the\\
locker and we need certain numbers?\\
==== 1021402 ====
We should try some combinations then,\\
Carlos.\\
==== 1021500 ====
...Let's try this again.\\
==== 1021600 ====
Whoa... A coin came out.\\
==== 1021601 ====
Yes! That means the right combination gives\\
an item.\\
==== 1021602 ====
We were pretty lucky. I didn't think setting\\
them to random numbers would work.\\
==== 1021700 ====
Hey look! A coin came out the side!\\
==== 1021701 ====
We were right. The correct combination\\
caused something to happen.\\
==== 1021702 ====
Uh, we kind of made a mess searching for\\
this hint. I'm glad it was worth it.\\
==== 1021800 ====
Hmm... Nothing's happening. I guess random\\
numbers won't work.\\
==== 1021900 ====
The dice numbers probably need to match\\
something.\\
==== 1021901 ====
Maybe we can find a clue. We haven't\\
checked out this table yet.\\
==== 1022000 ====
There's nothing else here.\\
==== 1022100 ====
Of course random numbers don't work...\\
==== 1022200 ====
Nothing's happening. What should the numbers\\
be?\\
==== 1022201 ====
Didn't the cards on the table make an\\
equation?\\
==== 1022202 ====
Maybe solving it will give us the answer for\\
the dice.\\
==== 1030100 ====
Hey, this button says OPEN. Think this is for\\
the door?\\
==== 1030101 ====
But it's under this glass. We couldn't press it\\
even if we wanted to.\\
==== 1030102 ====
It says "Collect 5 coins!" down here at the\\
bottom.\\
==== 1030103 ====
Does that mean if we get five coins we'll be\\
able to push the button?\\
==== 1030104 ====
And it looks like the coins go in these holes.\\
Let's start looking.\\
==== 1030200 ====
This button is tempting me so bad...\\
==== 1030201 ====
No way you're going to open it like this. Let's\\
see if we can find the coins.\\
==== 1030300 ====
Damn. I thought this hammer would break the\\
glass.\\
==== 1030301 ====
It looks like it's reinforced glass. It's\\
difficult to break.\\
==== 1030400 ====
Ugh. This fire hook can't break it.\\
==== 1030500 ====
Thank God. We can FINALLY push this\\
button.\\
==== 1030501 ====
But does it really open the door?\\
==== 1030502 ====
You know, you're right. It could be a trap.\\
==== 1030503 ====
It always happens in movies... The bad guys\\
rush to push the button...\\
==== 1030504 ====
Uh, Carlos. It's the, um, leader's job to do\\
this kind of thing.\\
==== 1030505 ====
What?! You're the one who wanted to push it\\
so badly...\\
==== 1030506 ====
...\\
==== 1030507 ====
I guess it's probably not going to explode or\\
anything...\\
==== 1030508 ====
Okay. I am the eldest here, so I'll do the\\
pushing.\\
==== 1030600 ====
There are five holes here.\\
==== 1030601 ====
It says "Collect 5 coins!" at the bottom. Then\\
the holes are for the coins?\\
==== 1030700 ====
There are five holes here that can fit the\\
coins.\\
==== 1030800 ====
Ah! The coin fits perfectly.\\
==== 1030801 ====
But just one doesn't do anything. The case is\\
still locked.\\
==== 1030900 ====
One coin has been placed in a hole. We need\\
4 more.\\
==== 1031000 ====
Okay, the second coin is in.\\
==== 1031001 ====
The glass still hasn't moved. We need to fill\\
the other 3 holes.\\
==== 1031100 ====
Two coins have been placed. We have to add\\
3 more to have all 5.\\
==== 1031200 ====
Now we have 3. Just 2 to go.\\
==== 1031300 ====
Three coins are in place. We need to put the\\
last 2 in.\\
==== 1031400 ====
This makes 4. Only 1 more.\\
==== 1031500 ====
We've found 4 so far. We only need 1 more.\\
==== 1031600 ====
And now we finally have all five in!\\
==== 1031601 ====
Yes, we did it! The glass covering the button\\
is open!\\
==== 1031602 ====
So putting those coins here DID open the\\
case.\\
==== 1031700 ====
Five coins are sitting in the holes. No need to\\
take them out.\\
==== 1031800 ====
It says "Collect 5 coins!" here.\\
==== 1031900 ====
So does that mean we need to find 5 coins?\\
==== 1032000 ====
We have all the coins, so let's put them in.\\
==== 1032100 ====
All five coins are placed.\\
==== 1032101 ====
Let's check the button up top. We should be\\
able to press it now.\\
==== 1040100 ====
Below the floor storage... I see a narrow slit\\
on the top.\\
==== 1040101 ====
Doubt we'll be able to open this with our bare\\
hands.\\
==== 1040200 ====
The cover for the storage under the floor is\\
closed.\\
==== 1040300 ====
Maybe we can use this fire hook to open the\\
cover...\\
==== 1040301 ====
Awesome! We got it open!\\
==== 1040400 ====
Wait...5, 5, 6, 4...and X? What is this?\\
==== 1040401 ====
I think something's written under the red X.\\
==== 1040500 ====
5564X... What's up with this red X though?\\
==== 1040501 ====
Beats me. How about we search around\\
some more for now?\\
==== 1040600 ====
5564X... Hmm, X...\\
==== 1040601 ====
Didn't that hammer we picked up have a red\\
X on it?\\
==== 1040602 ====
You're right. Maybe it's related?\\
==== 1040700 ====
The hammer and the number 5564X both\\
have red Xs... Are they connected?\\
==== 1040800 ====
How about hitting the X mark with the\\
hammer?\\
==== 1040801 ====
Nothing's happening. Maybe this isn't where\\
we're supposed to hit?\\
==== 1040802 ====
It's possible. I wonder what the numbers in\\
5564X mean...\\
==== 1040900 ====
Who would've guessed this was hint for\\
opening the chess set.\\
==== 1041000 ====
It's a wooden hammer.\\
==== 1041001 ====
We can probably use this somewhere. We\\
should take it with us.\\
==== 1041100 ====
Nothing else here. Let's check other places\\
out.\\
==== 1050100 ====
I think something needs to go on the upper\\
section of this slot machine.\\
==== 1050101 ====
You're right, it's completely blank. But what?\\
==== 1050200 ====
There's a blank space for something at the\\
top of the slot machine.\\
==== 1050300 ====
Hey! The power turned on when I put the\\
roulette wheel here.\\
==== 1050400 ====
It's designed to turn on when the roulette\\
wheel is placed here.\\
==== 1050500 ====
The roulette wheel is attached to the\\
machine.\\
==== 1050600 ====
Hmm, it says..."Make a Heart!" here.\\
==== 1050601 ====
Huh? How exactly do you make a heart?\\
==== 1050700 ====
Hmm, make a heart...\\
==== 1050701 ====
There's a heart shape down here near the\\
bottom. Maybe put something there?\\
==== 1050800 ====
"Make a Heart!"... You don't think it's saying\\
we need to actually make one, right?\\
==== 1050801 ====
Maybe it's connected to the frame in the\\
shape of a heart down below?\\
==== 1050802 ====
I think so, too. We might have to put\\
something in there.\\
==== 1050900 ====
Maybe "Make a Heart!" is telling us to make\\
one using the frame at the bottom.\\
==== 1050901 ====
Those small pieces we got earlier would fit\\
perfectly.\\
==== 1051000 ====
We already made a heart here, so let's check\\
something else out.\\
==== 1051100 ====
What's this? It says "odds = 35(%)"...\\
==== 1051101 ====
"Odds" is how you explain win rates in\\
gambling.\\
==== 1051102 ====
But that’s usually percentage, not odds.\\
Maybe that's why it's in parentheses?\\
==== 1051103 ====
You seem to know a lot about this, Junpei. Do\\
you play slots a lot?\\
==== 1051104 ====
Naw, just a little horse racing...to let off\\
steam and unwind, you know?\\
==== 1051105 ====
There happened to be an odds 35 race, so,\\
well, I bet $100 on it...\\
==== 1051106 ====
...\\
==== 1051107 ====
I take it you didn't win, huh. Don't be so hard\\
on yourself. It happens.\\
==== 1051200 ====
It says "odds = 35(%)"... I'd rather not think\\
about that number anytime soon.\\
==== 1051300 ====
Pulling the lever does nothing. The reels\\
won't spin.\\
==== 1051301 ====
I don't think power's running through it. How\\
do we turn it on?\\
==== 1051400 ====
The machine's not powered on. The lever\\
isn't doing anything.\\
==== 1051500 ====
The reels should turn now if we pull the lever.\\
==== 1051501 ====
What?! Three 7s on the first spin? Jackpot?!\\
==== 1051502 ====
Oh, something small came out of the\\
machine.\\
==== 1051600 ====
Hey, hold on. Why isn't this thing working?\\
The power's still on, right?\\
==== 1051601 ====
It's likely programmed to only spin once and\\
hit all 7s.\\
==== 1051602 ====
You're probably right. Hard to believe Junpei\\
would hit the jackpot on the first try.\\
==== 1051700 ====
Nothing happens when we pull the lever. The\\
reels are stuck on the 7s.\\
==== 1051800 ====
There's a heart on this frame here.\\
==== 1051801 ====
For being only 9 by 9 squares, it's rather\\
pretty.\\
==== 1051802 ====
Hot springs hotels have these kinds of puzzle\\
games a lot.\\
==== 1051900 ====
A 9 x 9 square with a heart shape in the\\
middle.\\
==== 1052000 ====
Maybe we can make a heart shape with\\
these pieces here.\\
==== 1052100 ====
I think we can make a heart shape using the\\
pieces.\\
==== 1052200 ====
Yeah! We made a heart shape!\\
==== 1052201 ====
Something came out at the bottom.\\
==== 1052202 ====
A coin...and a card calendar?\\
==== 1052300 ====
Hmm, nope. This is not going how I thought it\\
would.\\
==== 1052400 ====
Augh, I can't make a heart shape... This is\\
harder than I thought.\\
==== 1052401 ====
There's a trick to these kinds of puzzles. Try\\
using the larger pieces first.\\
==== 1052500 ====
I think we did a pretty good job.\\
==== 1052501 ====
I saw you were struggling a little there,\\
Carlos.\\
==== 1052502 ====
Oh, and you're an expert at these kinds of\\
puzzles?\\
==== 1052503 ====
Nope, I suck at them. Too much stress on my\\
brain. I hate those puzzle rings especially.\\
==== 1052600 ====
The puzzle pieces arrange into a rather nice\\
heart shape.\\
==== 1052700 ====
It says EXTREME SLOTS here on the\\
bottom.\\
==== 1052701 ====
Extreme, huh? Well, it better live up to\\
expectations...\\
==== 1052800 ====
The bottom of the machine reads "EXTREME\\
SLOTS."\\
==== 1052900 ====
There's nothing in the tray here.\\
==== 1052901 ====
We should get coins flowing out if we get a\\
match on the machine.\\
==== 1053000 ====
Nothing here, but if we hit on a match, maybe\\
something will come out.\\
==== 1053100 ====
So this is what came out of the machine...\\
==== 1053101 ====
Looks like puzzle pieces. Too bad it's not\\
coins.\\
==== 1053102 ====
What can we use these for...?\\
==== 1053200 ====
Nothing left in the tray. We got all of the\\
pieces.\\
==== 1053300 ====
We got a coin and a card calendar by\\
completing a heart.\\
==== 1053301 ====
The coin's pretty obvious, but what do we do\\
with a calendar?\\
==== 1053302 ====
The puzzle pieces ended up being useful, so\\
let's just take it with us.\\
==== 1053400 ====
There's nothing else in the tray. Let's keep\\
looking around.\\
==== 1060100 ====
Huh? I think this is a slot for a card.\\
==== 1060101 ====
Let's use the superhero trading card Junpei\\
treasured back in grade school.\\
==== 1060102 ====
Like I would still have that. That was forever\\
ago.\\
==== 1060103 ====
But hmm, a card... Did we find anything that\\
could fit there?\\
==== 1060200 ====
There's a spot for a card at the top half of\\
the jukebox.\\
==== 1060300 ====
Hey, that card calendar we got from the slot\\
machine... Think it'd work here?\\
==== 1060301 ====
It went in... And the jukebox started playing\\
music.\\
==== 1060302 ====
Oh! Look, those buttons that look like dice fell\\
out.\\
==== 1060400 ====
The music began playing when I put the card\\
in, but nothing else happened.\\
==== 1060500 ====
The jukebox powered on when I put the card\\
calendar in.\\
==== 1060501 ====
What a strange jukebox.\\
==== 1060600 ====
The machine started up when I inserted the\\
card calendar here.\\
==== 1060700 ====
The dice-shaped buttons are really stuck on.\\
I doubt we can take them off.\\
==== 1060701 ====
It'd be a lot of fun to play with them though.\\
==== 1060800 ====
The dice are stuck to the machine. We can't\\
force them off.\\
==== 1060900 ====
Just three holes where the dice were...\\
==== 1060901 ====
I didn't think turning the machine on would\\
cause the dice to fall off.\\
==== 1060902 ====
Who comes up with these gimmicks?\\
==== 1061000 ====
Three empty holes where the dice were.\\
==== 1061100 ====
Can we put the dice back in again?\\
==== 1061101 ====
I kind of want to find out too, but they're\\
probably useful somewhere else.\\
==== 1061200 ====
These dice were in these holes just a little\\
while ago.\\
==== 1061201 ====
Didn't we see holes about the same size over\\
on the card table?\\
==== 1061202 ====
It'd definitely make more sense to use them\\
over there.\\
==== 1061300 ====
The dice that were here are being used on the\\
table now.\\
==== 1061400 ====
It says..."JUKE 803."\\
==== 1061401 ====
What?! JUKE 803? The "death" model?!\\
==== 1061402 ====
Huh? You know about this jukebox, Akane?\\
==== 1061403 ====
Yes... It's the cursed jukebox that travels\\
from bar to bar.\\
==== 1061404 ====
At 8:03 exactly, it plays a song so depressing\\
that whoever's listening commits suicide.\\
==== 1061405 ====
That's how the machine got its nickname...\\
"Juky, the Grim Reaper of Eight-o-Three!"\\
==== 1061406 ====
I can't decide if that's terrifying or cute...\\
==== 1061407 ====
And how exactly did this rumor spread if\\
everyone who listened to it died...\\
==== 1061500 ====
Akane's story aside, this machine's model\\
number appears to be JUKE 803.\\
==== 1061600 ====
The three dice on the floor range from 1 to 6.\\
==== 1061601 ====
I wish we could relax and play board games\\
with these, but let's just take them with us.\\
==== 1070100 ====
It's a fireplace. There's no fire in it right\\
now.\\
==== 1070101 ====
Wow, it's big enough to fit someone inside.\\
==== 1070102 ====
How funny would it be if Zero decided to play\\
hide and seek here.\\
==== 1070200 ====
It's a well-made fireplace. The fire's not lit.\\
==== 1070300 ====
How about we start a fire with these\\
matches?\\
==== 1070301 ====
Oh... Now we have a fire.\\
==== 1070302 ====
Just seeing a fire in a fireplace during winter\\
makes you feel warm...\\
==== 1070400 ====
A fire is burning in the fireplace. Maybe we\\
should put something in it?\\
==== 1070401 ====
Oh, I know. Let's get some sweet potatoes.\\
It's the perfect season for them.\\
==== 1070402 ====
Maybe not, Akane. We'll forget the serious\\
situation we're in if we do that...\\
==== 1070500 ====
The fire's burning strong. Let's put something\\
in...besides sweet potatoes.\\
==== 1070600 ====
Wait a second. Are you putting out the fire,\\
Carlos?\\
==== 1070601 ====
We could still use it. Let's let it go for now.\\
==== 1070700 ====
The wooden box! Are you going to burn it in\\
the fire?\\
==== 1070701 ====
I was just wondering what would happen. But\\
the contents inside would burn too...\\
==== 1070702 ====
Could I see it for a sec? ...And in you go!\\
==== 1070703 ====
J-Junpei?! No...! Why did you do that?!\\
==== 1070704 ====
You just gotta have faith with these things,\\
or you'll end up never moving forward.\\
==== 1070800 ====
The wooden box is burning.\\
==== 1070801 ====
I wonder if something's in there. But I can't\\
take it out with my bare hands.\\
==== 1070900 ====
The box is burning... I need something to help\\
me take it out.\\
==== 1071000 ====
Let's use this bottle of water to put out the\\
fire.\\
==== 1071001 ====
...And it's out. What happened to the box?\\
==== 1071100 ====
Hmm... We can use this fire hook to pull the\\
box out.\\
==== 1071101 ====
But the fire's really strong. Maybe we should\\
put it out first, just in case.\\
==== 1071200 ====
We might be able to use this later. Let's just\\
hold on to it for now.\\
==== 1071300 ====
I can see the ashes of the box there inside\\
the fireplace.\\
==== 1071301 ====
But it's still really hot. We can't get at it with\\
our bare hands.\\
==== 1071400 ====
I can see something in the back, but it's still\\
hot. Better not touch it with our hands.\\
==== 1071500 ====
If we use this fire hook, we can poke around\\
inside the fireplace.\\
==== 1071501 ====
Hey, is that a coin underneath the ashes of\\
the box?\\
==== 1071502 ====
Guess tossing that box in was the right thing\\
to do after all. Let's grab it.\\
==== 1071600 ====
Burnt ashes litter the fireplace. Nothing else\\
is in here.\\
==== 1071700 ====
This is a bottle of oil? It says "oil 130(ml)" on\\
it.\\
==== 1071701 ====
Maybe it's for the fireplace? I wonder why\\
that label says that though.\\
==== 1071702 ====
Maybe 130(ml) of "oil" is the max you can put\\
in the fireplace before it explodes?\\
==== 1071703 ====
Or you need to use 130(ml) of "oil" to get your\\
fried chicken to taste delicious...\\
==== 1071704 ====
Fried chicken? What is this, Zero's Cooking\\
Hour?\\
==== 1071705 ====
Hmm, "oil 130(ml)"... Why is the unit of\\
measurement in parentheses?\\
==== 1071800 ====
A bottle of oil. The label says "oil 130(ml)."\\
==== 1071900 ====
There are two candles up here.\\
==== 1071901 ====
Looks like they're glued in place...\\
==== 1071902 ====
Maybe that's so they don't fall off.\\
==== 1072000 ====
There are two candles above the fireplace,\\
but we can't move them.\\
==== 1080100 ====
There's a closed portable chess set on the\\
table and a...\\
==== 1080101 ====
Bottle of...jam. It'd look tasty on a piece of\\
toast.\\
==== 1080102 ====
Better not eat it, Akane. Could be poisoned.\\
==== 1080200 ====
There's a closed chess set and a bottle of\\
jam on the table.\\
==== 1080300 ====
There's an open chess set and a bottle of jam\\
here. What a weird combination...\\
==== 1080301 ====
Well, a lot of professional Shogi players like\\
to eat sweets. Things like chocolate.\\
==== 1080302 ====
The more you use your brain, the more sugar\\
you need. Maybe that's why the jam's there.\\
==== 1080400 ====
There's an open chess set and a bottle of jam\\
on the table.\\
==== 1080500 ====
Huh? The chess board doesn't want to open.\\
But I don't see anything keeping it shut...\\
==== 1080501 ====
Hey, is there something off about the word\\
"chess" there or is it just me?\\
==== 1080600 ====
Oh... The "e" in "chess" is mirrored!\\
==== 1080601 ====
Aha! That's it! That's why it felt so off to me.\\
==== 1080602 ====
But why is only the "e" mirrored? Is it just a\\
typo?\\
==== 1080700 ====
Why is only the letter "e" mirrored on this\\
thing...\\
==== 1080701 ====
Hey, you know, couldn't "chess" sort of look\\
like numbers?\\
==== 1080702 ====
You're right. Each "s" would be a 5, the\\
mirrored "e" is 6, and "h" is 4...\\
==== 1080703 ====
But that leaves the "c" out since it doesn't\\
look like a number.\\
==== 1080800 ====
Maybe if we hit the "c" with this hammer...\\
==== 1080801 ====
A cylindrical piece came out.\\
==== 1080802 ====
Ah, so this was how the chess board was\\
locked. That was pretty tricky.\\
==== 1080900 ====
Something's drawn on the board.\\
==== 1080901 ====
Looking at how these arrows are going, is\\
this how each piece moves?\\
==== 1081000 ====
Chess piece movements are drawn on the\\
board.\\
==== 1081100 ====
These are the movements of the pawn,\\
bishop, and king pieces.\\
==== 1081200 ====
This is...?\\
==== 1081201 ====
A chess rule book. Are we supposed to check\\
this?\\
==== 1081300 ====
What?! This jam... It's "JAM 100(%) pure"?\\
==== 1081301 ====
Carlos? Why are you staring at it? Do you\\
recognize it?\\
==== 1081302 ====
Yeah... My sister really likes this. I bought it\\
for her a lot.\\
==== 1081303 ====
"Take some in the morning and you'll be\\
strong and beautiful inside and out!"\\
==== 1081304 ====
"JAM 100(%) pure!" I'd hear her quote that ad\\
all the time.\\
==== 1081305 ====
It's great you have such a fond memory, but\\
you should never make your voice that high.\\
==== 1081306 ====
It sounds like a TV commercial aimed at\\
young girls.\\
==== 1081307 ====
Ah, JAM 100(%) pure... Never thought I'd see\\
it again.\\
==== 1081400 ====
JAM 100(%) pure... This makes me think of\\
my sister.\\
==== 1090100 ====
Oh wow, this leather chair's so comfy.\\
==== 1090101 ====
Well, the comfort level of a sofa or chair is\\
very important.\\
==== 1090200 ====
This looks like an expensive leather chair.\\
==== 1100100 ====
A leather chair.\\
==== 1100101 ====
You can rest here for a while if you're tired,\\
Carlos.\\
==== 1100102 ====
No, this isn't the time or place. Let's check\\
out something else.\\
==== 1100200 ====
A leather chair. I could sink right into it if I\\
wanted, but not right now.\\
==== 1110100 ====
The chart on this table... Four spots are\\
circled.\\
==== 1110101 ====
5, 21, 26, and 28... I've no idea what they\\
mean.\\
==== 1110200 ====
There are four spots circled on the table. I'm\\
not sure what they mean.\\
==== 1110300 ====
I wonder what those circles on the chart\\
mean...\\
==== 1110301 ====
Hey, hold on. Didn't we just see something\\
similar?\\
==== 1110400 ====
The positions of the reds and blacks are the\\
same on this chart and the table.\\
==== 1110401 ====
I doubt it's a coincidence... The circles must\\
be related.\\
==== 1110500 ====
The circles on the table were the hint to\\
removing the roulette wheel.\\
==== 1110600 ====
This is a roulette wheel, just like the ones you\\
find in casinos.\\
==== 1110601 ====
There's some kind of input here. Let's test it\\
out.\\
==== 1110700 ====
We can input letters of the alphabet here.\\
How about we try it one more time.\\
==== 1110800 ====
What? The roulette wheel detached. This\\
must mean...\\
==== 1110801 ====
We got the answer right?\\
==== 1110802 ====
No way. I just put in the first thing I thought\\
of.\\
==== 1110900 ====
Oh? The wheel detached.\\
==== 1110901 ====
All we had to do was input the corresponding\\
letter from the chart.\\
==== 1110902 ====
Well, that was more straightforward than I\\
expected for this place.\\
==== 1111000 ====
Ugh. Well, we sucked with that... What was it\\
we're supposed to put in?\\
==== 1111001 ====
Alphabet... Alphabet... Was there a clue\\
somewhere?\\
==== 1111100 ====
Inputting at random's not going to work.\\
Let's see if we can find a clue somewhere.\\
==== 1111101 ====
Maybe those circles on the roulette chart are\\
some kind of hint?\\
==== 1111200 ====
Looks like we got it wrong. We need to put\\
four letters in...\\
==== 1111201 ====
There were four circles on the chart. Maybe\\
they're connected to this?\\
==== 1111300 ====
Hmm... Four letters... What do we need to put\\
in here?\\
==== 1111301 ====
Hmm, remember the chart on the table, and\\
the alphabet chart?\\
==== 1111302 ====
Maybe they go together?\\
==== 1111303 ====
If you're right, then the four circles should\\
match on the alphabet chart.\\
==== 1111400 ====
There's something here under the wheel.\\
==== 1111401 ====
It's a coin.\\
==== 1111500 ====
This is the spot where the wheel used to be.\\
Now there's nothing here.\\
==== 1120100 ====
This armor's pretty well-made. But...why is it\\
here?\\
==== 1120101 ====
What if...the armor starts moving to attack if\\
someone cheats?\\
==== 1120102 ====
Don't be silly, Junpei. We're not in some game\\
or movie.\\
==== 1120200 ====
It's well-made armor. Judging by how stiff\\
the limbs are, it's not going to move.\\
==== 1130100 ====
...\\
==== 1130101 ====
What's wrong, Junpei? Why are you staring at\\
it so hard?\\
==== 1130102 ====
Oh, I just thought maybe it was one of those\\
door motion-sensor activated things.\\
==== 1130200 ====
A sturdy set of armor. It doesn't seem like it\\
will talk.\\
==== 1130300 ====
Huh? Something's stuck in the helmet.\\
==== 1130301 ====
A chart with letters of the alphabet on it...?\\
==== 1140100 ====
A suit of armor. I always liked these things.\\
==== 1140101 ====
Why not try it on, Carlos?\\
==== 1140102 ====
This is not exactly the best place to be doing\\
that. Besides, it looks hard to put on.\\
==== 1140200 ====
A suit of armor that looks a little old. I have\\
this urge to try it on.\\
==== 1140300 ====
Hold on. This thing's holding something in its\\
right hand.\\
==== 1140301 ====
It's...a fire hook?\\
==== 1150100 ====
A suit of armor... Having one of these\\
standing in your home would be pretty cool.\\
==== 1150101 ====
Yeah... It'd be a great statement, even if it\\
didn't match the interior design.\\
==== 1150102 ====
...It'd definitely dominate a small room.\\
==== 1150200 ====
A solid-looking suit of armor. It's a strong\\
interior design choice.\\
==== 1160100 ====
Urgh... Dammit. The door's shut tight.\\
==== 1160101 ====
It's locked. We'll just have to find a way to\\
open it.\\
==== 1160200 ====
This is the door that leads to the hallway. It's\\
locked right now and won't open.\\
==== 1170100 ====
It's the United States flag.\\
==== 1170101 ====
It's kind of cool that each star represents a\\
state.\\
==== 1170102 ====
I like the Japanese flag, too. It's simple and\\
clean.\\
==== 1170200 ====
It's the US flag. Pretty normal.\\
==== 1180100 ====
H-Hold up... Is this the funyarinpa?! I didn't\\
know it could be a copper plate!\\
==== 1180101 ====
...Funyarinpa?\\
==== 1180102 ====
What are you going on about, Junpei? It's just\\
a memorial plate.\\
==== 1180200 ====
Junpei was super excited for a minute, but\\
it's just a copper memorial plate.\\
==== 1190100 ====
This says New Caledonia...\\
==== 1190101 ====
It's a popular vacation spot. Blue skies...\\
Endless ocean... I'd like to see it someday.\\
==== 1190102 ====
It'd be pretty sad to go alone though.\\
==== 1190200 ====
It's a poster of New Caledonia. You can still\\
see the blue sky through the dirt.\\
==== 1200100 ====
I think this thing is probably a clock.\\
==== 1200101 ====
Yeah, a digital one. But nothing's on the\\
display. Maybe the batteries are missing?\\
==== 1200102 ====
We could toss it around like a Frisbee.\\
...What? You gotta admit it looks like one.\\
==== 1200200 ====
A digital clock. Since we can check the time\\
on our bracelets, we'll keep looking around.\\
==== 1210100 ====
Oh hey, it says "Aloha" on that surfboard. It\\
sounds so happy and carefree.\\
==== 1210101 ====
That's only because we're trapped here.\\
==== 1210102 ====
You feel so free when you're surfing... A\\
complete 180 to how we feel in here.\\
==== 1210200 ====
The surfboard has some hibiscus flowers on\\
it, but there's nothing else special about it.\\
==== 1220100 ====
A picture of a big moon... It's beautiful.\\
==== 1220101 ====
Yeah... Looking at this kind of calms me down.\\
==== 1220200 ====
No way to turn into a werewolf staring at a\\
boring picture. Let's keep looking.\\
==== 1230100 ====
It's a picture of a landscape at night.\\
==== 1230101 ====
No switches hidden behind it...\\
==== 1230102 ====
Let's search somewhere else, you two.\\
==== 1230200 ====
Just an ordinary night landscape.\\
==== 1240100 ====
Some neon lights... Reminds me of wandering\\
down streets at night.\\
==== 1240101 ====
You go out late a lot?\\
==== 1240102 ====
Only when I'm in the mood to drink alone.\\
==== 1240103 ====
Walking the streets distracted me from\\
everything I had to deal with at work...\\
==== 1240104 ====
For me, it's the opposite. Walking alone at\\
night makes me nervous...\\
==== 1240200 ====
Just some neon tubes. There's nothing\\
strange about them.\\
==== 1250100 ====
This board has some newspaper clippings\\
and photos...\\
==== 1250101 ====
But they're all so old that we can't read a\\
word.\\
==== 1250102 ====
No clues then. Let's move on to the next\\
place.\\
==== 1250200 ====
There are some clippings on the board, but\\
we can't read any of them.\\
==== 1260100 ====
Well, there are a grand total of ten lights on\\
the ceiling...\\
==== 1260101 ====
I wonder if one will crack open with a\\
"Congrats" banner once we get out of here.\\
==== 1260102 ====
I doubt Zero is the type to do something as\\
cute as that...\\
==== 1260200 ====
Nothing strange about the lights. They're just\\
glowing whitely.\\
==== 2010100 ====
They're matches. You can start a fire if you\\
strike one against a rough surface.\\
==== 2010101 ====
It's easy for me now, but I was afraid of\\
lighting fires when I was young.\\
==== 2010102 ====
Now that you mention it, I remember watching\\
you being scared to light a firework.\\
==== 2010103 ====
Oh! You still remember!\\
==== 2010104 ====
Yeah, I seem to recall you cowering and\\
hiding like a baby behind me.\\
==== 2010105 ====
Aww, don't tease me like that.\\
==== 2010200 ====
Just regular matches. Maybe we can use them\\
somewhere.\\
==== 2020100 ====
A bottle of water.\\
==== 2020101 ====
Water you saying, Junpei? The shelter must\\
be fully prepared, so they bottle of them.\\
==== 2020102 ====
...\\
==== 2020103 ====
...\\
==== 2020104 ====
What? What? It's...just a joke! Come on you\\
two, say something?!\\
==== 2020200 ====
It's a bottle of water. There must be more to\\
this than a bad pun.\\
==== 2030100 ====
This box... I don't see a lid to open it\\
anywhere.\\
==== 2030101 ====
I can hear something when I shake it... Hey\\
Junpei, try to karate chop it open.\\
==== 2030102 ====
If I could do that, I'd make a career as a pro\\
fighter.\\
==== 2030200 ====
A wooden box. Something's inside, but\\
there's no way to open it.\\
==== 2040100 ====
A fire hook. It's for putting and arranging\\
things in a fireplace.\\
==== 2040101 ====
You could use it as a weapon, but I don't think\\
it'd be able to break down the door.\\
==== 2040200 ====
A fire hook. You can use it to put things in a\\
fireplace.\\
==== 2050100 ====
This hammer... There's a red X on one end.\\
==== 2050101 ====
Oh, I know. When Zero shows up, we'll hit him\\
with that X...\\
==== 2050102 ====
What, like whack-a-mole?\\
==== 2050103 ====
If that's what it takes to get us out of here...\\
Nope. No way that's right.\\
==== 2050200 ====
A wooden hammer with a red X on one end.\\
==== 2060100 ====
This is the cylinder from the chess set. There\\
are three windows showing chess pieces.\\
==== 2060101 ====
Let's see if we can do something with it.\\
==== 2060200 ====
This cylinder... We only need to line up the\\
right three chess pieces.\\
==== 2060300 ====
Yes! It opened and something came out!\\
==== 2060301 ====
A coin, and a note with numbers on it. Well\\
done, Carlos.\\
==== 2060400 ====
Hmm, if only we could get these marks right.\\
We might get something.\\
==== 2060401 ====
Now that I think about it, wasn't there\\
something written on the chess board?\\
==== 2060500 ====
Hmm, we just need the right three chess\\
pieces in these windows...\\
==== 2060501 ====
Wasn't there a rule book near the chess\\
board? Maybe it can help.\\
==== 2060600 ====
We just need to get the three pieces to match\\
the chess board, but which ones?\\
==== 2060601 ====
The rule book explains each piece's\\
movement. So let's look at it again.\\
==== 2070100 ====
Well, this wheel detached from the table...\\
Where can we use it?\\
==== 2070101 ====
You could wear it on your head?\\
==== 2070102 ====
As if Zero would go through the effort of\\
making a hat. I might die from how stupid it is.\\
==== 2070200 ====
It's a roulette wheel. Maybe we can find\\
someplace to use it.\\
==== 2080100 ====
There are a total of 10 pieces, and they're all\\
different sizes.\\
==== 2080101 ====
We can probably make a shape with them, but\\
it's going to be hard with them all different.\\
==== 2080200 ====
Ten puzzle pieces. We can make some sort of\\
shape with them.\\
==== 2090100 ====
This card calendar... It has a different card\\
behind each month.\\
==== 2090101 ====
January Ace, November Jack, and December\\
Queen... It works, but it's still strange.\\
==== 2090102 ====
I wonder why the first letter is emphasized...\\
And there's this weird barcode on the back.\\
==== 2090200 ====
A card calendar with a barcode on the back.\\
==== 2090201 ====
Each month corresponds to a playing card,\\
and the first letter of each is emphasized.\\
==== 2100100 ====
These dice... Yup, 1 through 6, pretty normal.\\
==== 2100101 ====
They're often used in gambling and gaming.\\
==== 2100102 ====
My sister used to always con me into playing\\
board games with the family.\\
==== 2100200 ====
They're regular 6-sided dice that go from 1 to\\
6.\\
==== 2110100 ====
This coin was in the wooden box.\\
==== 2110101 ====
Why would Zero go through all that trouble\\
just to have us burn the box up in the end?\\
==== 2110200 ====
The coin that was in the wooden box. It's not\\
hot at all right now.\\
==== 2120100 ====
This coin was in the cylinder.\\
==== 2120101 ====
To think we had to use chess to get it. Though\\
that makes sense seeing what room we're in.\\
==== 2120200 ====
The coin that was in that cylinder. There's\\
nothing special about it.\\
==== 2130100 ====
This is the coin we found under the roulette\\
wheel.\\
==== 2130101 ====
Coins are so tantalizing. Whenever you have\\
a lot of them, you just feel happy.\\
==== 2130102 ====
Well, they are shiny, and remind you of money.\\
==== 2130200 ====
This coin was under the roulette wheel.\\
==== 2140100 ====
We got this coin by completing the heart\\
puzzle.\\
==== 2140101 ====
I wish it'd given out more. It WAS a slot\\
machine after all.\\
==== 2140102 ====
The feeling of having a tray overflowing with\\
coins... It must feel good.\\
==== 2140200 ====
This coin was from completing the heart\\
puzzle.\\
==== 2150100 ====
We got this coin from the dice table.\\
==== 2150101 ====
Did you ever gather coins as a kid?\\
==== 2150102 ====
It was never just coins. Anything shiny would\\
catch our attention.\\
==== 2150103 ====
Marbles, bottle caps... You know, that sounds\\
a lot like what crows hoard. Huh.\\
==== 2150200 ====
This coin was from the dice table. There's\\
nothing unusual about it.\\
