==== 6159 ====
Dammit. I figured brute force wouldn't work.\\
==== 6160 ====
So, this is Control.\\
==== 6161 ====
The air, water, and electricity for the shelter\\
are all managed here.\\
==== 6162 ====
This is probably where transmissions to the\\
outside world happen.\\
==== 6163 ====
But...\\
==== 6164 ====
It's disconnected.\\
==== 6165 ====
Guess we can't order a bunch of pizza then.\\
==== 6166 ====
There are a lot of monitors here.\\
==== 6167 ====
I think this might let us review the footage\\
from the security cameras.\\
==== 6168 ====
Huh? There are security cameras in this\\
place?\\
==== 6169 ====
Carlos, it's 2028. I'd be more surprised if\\
there aren't cameras hidden everywhere...\\
==== 6170 ====
She's right. The ones I used for work were\\
about the size of a woman's nipple.\\
==== 6171 ====
Well, I guess not uniformly. Nipple sizes\\
differ.\\
==== 6172 ====
That's unusual.\\
==== 6173 ====
A carbon dioxide extinguisher.\\
==== 6174 ====
You're definitely a firefighter.\\
==== 6175 ====
Your eyes spot different things than us.\\
==== 6176 ====
Occupational hazard.\\
==== 6177 ====
Whenever I go somewhere new, I end up\\
checking the extinguishers first thing.\\
==== 6178 ====
I see...\\
==== 6179 ====
And because you do that all the time, you're\\
able to save so many lives...\\
==== 6180 ====
It's really nothing much.\\
==== 6181 ====
What are you talking about.\\
==== 6182 ====
You dive into danger without thinking twice\\
about your own safety.\\
==== 6183 ====
You do it like it's nothing. I think that's pretty\\
amazing!\\
==== 6184 ====
You know, I doubt it's all that.\\
==== 6185 ====
What are you trying to say?\\
==== 6186 ====
Well, Carlos was just doing what he was\\
trained to do... Isn't that right?\\
==== 6187 ====
Yeah. It's like you said.\\
==== 6189 ====
I'm sorry, Carlos.\\
==== 6190 ====
He's acting out now, but Junpei used to rush\\
to the rescue a lot when we were younger.\\
==== 6191 ====
Sorry, but I'm done with playing the action\\
hero.\\
==== 6192 ====
But why...\\
==== 6193 ====
Because I grew up.\\
==== 6194 ====
You just sound even more childish to me...\\
==== 6195 ====
Ah! It's January 1st!\\
==== 6196 ====
Worst way to start the year off...\\
==== 6197 ====
I've never not been able to say Happy New\\
Year to Maria before...\\
==== 6198 ====
Maria?\\
==== 6199 ====
My little sister.\\
==== 6200 ====
Well, take comfort knowing she's alive at\\
least.\\
==== 6201 ====
Don't forget what Zero said.\\
==== 6202 ====
"Very few of you will find yourselves able to\\
welcome a new 2029."\\
==== 6203 ====
Anyway, let's just figure a way out of this\\
room.\\
==== 6204 ====
Got it.\\
==== 6205 ====
Yeah, if we don't get our butts in gear, it\\
might be 2030 before we even get out.\\
==== 6206 ====
Oh! The fire's out!\\
==== 6208 ====
Damn, that was close.\\
==== 6209 ====
Guess that extinguisher up there helped, huh.\\
==== 6210 ====
Yeah, I think so.\\
==== 6211 ====
But that's bringing its own problems...\\
==== 6212 ====
Huh?\\
==== 6213 ====
It doesn't look like it's stopping...\\
==== 6214 ====
At this rate we'll...\\
==== 6217 ====
The percentage of carbon dioxide in the air is\\
roughly 0.04.\\
==== 6218 ====
IDLH level kicks in around 5%.\\
==== 6219 ====
IDLH...?\\
==== 6220 ====
The highest concentration level you can\\
continue to safely inhale.\\
==== 6221 ====
You lose consciousness shortly after it hits\\
7%, and after that...\\
==== 6222 ====
Now commencing...the Decision Game.\\
==== 6223 ====
A Decision Game...?!\\
==== 6224 ====
Ten lockers are beside the door...\\
==== 6225 ====
Within one of them...there is an oxygen mask.\\
==== 6226 ====
Which locker will you open...?\\
==== 6227 ====
Damn that Zero...!\\
==== 6228 ====
We need to pick one quickly...\\
==== 6229 ====
But which number is correct...\\
==== 6230 ====
Please choose, Carlos!\\
==== 6231 ====
The probability is 1 in 10...\\
==== 6232 ====
No hints. We'll have to go with our gut...\\
==== 6233 ====
Is that...your final decision?\\
==== 6234 ====
Wh-What...?\\
==== 6235 ====
I know...which locker contains the oxygen\\
mask...\\
==== 6236 ====
If there is a mask...in the locker you chose...\\
==== 6237 ====
Eight of the remaining nine lockers...will\\
randomly open.\\
==== 6238 ====
If the mask...is not within the locker you\\
chose...\\
==== 6239 ====
Eight lockers...except the correct one...will\\
open.\\
==== 6240 ====
Th-This is...\\
==== 6241 ====
The Monty Hall problem...\\
==== 6242 ====
The remaining lockers...have been narrowed\\
to two.\\
==== 6243 ====
Which locker will you open?\\
==== 6244 ====
You are permitted to change...or stay...with\\
your previous decision.\\
==== 6245 ====
The exit door...will be unlocked in...twenty\\
minutes.\\
==== 6246 ====
Twenty minutes?!\\
==== 6247 ====
There's no way we'll last twenty minâ€“\\
==== 6250 ====
Wh-What's wrong, Junpei?\\
==== 6251 ====
Oh man, that's awesome luck for us!\\
==== 6252 ====
Our chances went from 1 in 10 to 50:50?!\\
==== 6253 ====
That's not it, Junpei...!\\
==== 6254 ====
The probability is...\\
==== 6255 ====
It's actually...\\
==== 6256 ====
Akane!\\
==== 6257 ====
Hey Akane! Akane! Are you okay?!\\
==== 6258 ====
{Fi}Damn, this isn't good...{Fn}\\
==== 6259 ====
{Fi}We need to get that mask fast...{Fn}\\
==== 6260 ====
{Fi}Which is it...{Fn}\\
==== 6261 ====
{Fi}Which one will it be in...{Fn}\\
==== 6262 ====
Aw yeah, we did it!\\
==== 6263 ====
Yeah, but...\\
==== 6264 ====
You gotta be joking...\\
==== 6265 ====
One...\\
==== 6266 ====
Are you telling me there's only one?!\\
==== 6267 ====
The announcement... It never said that there\\
would be three...\\
==== 6268 ====
No...\\
==== 6270 ====
Ah, no, but it'll all be all right!\\
==== 6271 ====
We'll just rotate the mask between the three\\
of us!\\
==== 6272 ====
We can't...\\
==== 6273 ====
Why?!\\
==== 6274 ====
The door doesn't open for twenty minutes...\\
==== 6275 ====
The pump only has enough oxygen for one...\\
==== 6276 ====
Dammit. What the hell...\\
==== 6277 ====
Augh! What the hell!\\
==== 6280 ====
Hey Carlos...\\
==== 6281 ====
I have a favor to ask...\\
==== 6282 ====
I know...\\
==== 6283 ====
I haven't been a firefighter for ten years to\\
make the wrong choice now.\\
==== 6285 ====
Jun...pei...?\\
==== 6286 ====
Hey. I'm glad...\\
==== 6287 ====
I got to hear your voice one last time...\\
==== 6288 ====
Huh...?\\
==== 6289 ====
It brings back that time at the festival...\\
==== 6290 ====
Remember? We went together.\\
==== 6291 ====
You found this weird character mask, and\\
bought two.\\
==== 6292 ====
You tried to make me wear one...\\
==== 6293 ====
Oh that's right, you were wearing a yukata\\
then...\\
==== 6294 ====
You said it had been your mom's before she\\
died.\\
==== 6295 ====
That's why it was so big on you...\\
==== 6296 ====
I want to go to that festival again...\\
==== 6297 ====
Junpei, no...!\\
==== 6298 ====
Hurry! Put the mask on...!\\
==== 6299 ====
What...\\
==== 6300 ====
Junpei...\\
==== 6301 ====
JUNPEI!\\
==== 6302 ====
No...\\
==== 6303 ====
Why...\\
==== 6304 ====
NOOOOO!\\
==== 6306 ====
It's no use...\\
==== 6307 ====
There's no way that locker'll open...\\
==== 6308 ====
Why...?!\\
==== 6309 ====
It's just how the pieces fall...\\
==== 6310 ====
Looks like we're outta luck...\\
==== 6311 ====
Akane...\\
==== 6312 ====
If only I could've heard your voice one last\\
time...\\
==== 6313 ====
But it seems like...\\
==== 6314 ====
I'm really sorry, guys...\\
==== 6315 ====
Forgive me...\\
==== 6316 ====
Sorry...I couldn't save you...\\
==== 6317 ====
Um, are you sure...\\
==== 6318 ====
You're taking the word of that announcer\\
earlier?\\
==== 6319 ====
It's completely rubbish. All of it.\\
==== 6320 ====
Then everyone's alive...?\\
==== 6321 ====
Of course.\\
==== 6322 ====
We need to go get help...\\
==== 6323 ====
All right. Let's go.\\
==== 6324 ====
Okay...\\
==== 7860 ====
Damn it! Damn it!\\
==== 7861 ====
There's no way I'm dying here!\\
==== 7862 ====
Please don't...!\\
==== 7863 ====
Please!\\
==== 7865 ====
May you rest in peace.\\
==== 7866 ====
Desine fata deum flecti sperare precando.\\
==== 7869 ====
Wh-What's wrong, Carlos?\\
==== 7870 ====
Akane...\\
==== 7871 ====
So, it was a dream...?\\
==== 7872 ====
It must've been a pretty bad one...\\
==== 7873 ====
Though seeing where we are, I don't blame\\
you for having a nightmare...\\
==== 1010200 ====
There are a lot of buttons and switches on\\
this console...\\
==== 1010201 ====
Watch as a self-destruct sequence starts if\\
we just start pushing everything.\\
==== 1010202 ====
Ha ha. I can't say that's not entirely\\
impossible.\\
==== 1010300 ====
It's a console full of buttons and switches.\\
==== 1010400 ====
It's just a normal chair.\\
==== 1010401 ====
No time to rest now. Let's keep looking.\\
==== 1010500 ====
There's nothing special about this chair.\\
==== 1020300 ====
What's that on the monitor?\\
==== 1020301 ====
The letters S and W...on a door?\\
==== 1020302 ====
The S is red and the W is pink.\\
==== 1020303 ====
Is it saying we need to spell those letters out\\
with our bodies?\\
==== 1020304 ====
I doubt it's going to be like Sports Day back in\\
Japan, Junpei.\\
==== 1020400 ====
The monitor's displaying a door with a red S\\
and a pink W on it.\\
==== 1020500 ====
Hey, there are more letters behind the door.\\
==== 1020501 ====
SE, N, E, and SW.\\
==== 1020502 ====
I wonder why they're four different colors.\\
==== 1020600 ====
SE, N, E, SW... What do these mean?\\
==== 1020601 ====
Southeast... North... Maybe they're\\
directions?\\
==== 1020602 ====
Oh! Then E is east and SW is southwest!\\
==== 1020700 ====
The letters on the monitor are direction\\
hints.\\
==== 1020800 ====
The three small monitors at the top left are\\
blank.\\
==== 1020801 ====
...Maybe they'll show the faces of those who\\
die in here.\\
==== 1020802 ====
Don't say things like that, Junpei! It's bad\\
luck.\\
==== 1020900 ====
There are three small monitors by the large\\
one. They aren't showing anything.\\
==== 1021000 ====
Oh, these monitors are displaying something.\\
==== 1021001 ====
Top to bottom: B, E, and R.\\
==== 1021100 ====
The small monitors are displaying the letters\\
B, E, and R.\\
==== 1021200 ====
We used these letters for the password for\\
the sunglasses.\\
==== 1030300 ====
This large monitor here is showing some kind\\
of crane.\\
==== 1030301 ====
Where is that room... Oh, I think these buttons\\
can move the crane.\\
==== 1030302 ====
It's like those crane games... Okay then, let's\\
give it a go.\\
==== 1030303 ====
Are you good at these, Junpei?\\
==== 1030304 ====
Not really. Usually my wallet gives up first.\\
==== 1030305 ====
It's not exactly something to be proud of...\\
==== 1030400 ====
We can operate the crane from here. Let's\\
try it again.\\
==== 1030500 ====
Oh? Yeah! All the small monitors came on! I\\
must've done it!\\
==== 1030501 ====
That's incredible, Carlos!\\
==== 1030502 ====
Smooth moves there. I might be falling for\\
you now.\\
==== 1030600 ====
Phew... The small monitors lit up. It looks like\\
we did it.\\
==== 1030601 ====
So sound was the key to it. Impressive.\\
==== 1030700 ====
Damn... I don't think this is working.\\
==== 1030701 ====
Moving it around randomly won't work.\\
==== 1030800 ====
...Nope. But every time the crane moves it\\
makes a sound.\\
==== 1030801 ====
Maybe that's what's important about this.\\
Let's see if we can find a hint.\\
==== 1030900 ====
Hmm, it's just not working. We should pay\\
attention to the sound, right?\\
==== 1030901 ====
I think it's the same sound we heard from the\\
sunglasses.\\
==== 1031000 ====
What? Did I get the order wrong?\\
==== 1031001 ====
If you forgot the sound order we should listen\\
to the sunglasses again.\\
==== 1031100 ====
Moving this crane lights up all of the small\\
monitors on the console.\\
==== 1031200 ====
Four small monitors are at the bottom left.\\
But they aren't showing anything.\\
==== 1031201 ====
I really can't believe all these security\\
cameras are simply down...\\
==== 1031300 ====
Four small monitors. They aren't showing\\
anything.\\
==== 1031400 ====
These monitors are displaying letters.\\
==== 1031401 ====
From left to right is S, E, F, and E.\\
==== 1031500 ====
The monitors are showing S, E, F, and E from\\
left to right.\\
==== 1031600 ====
These letters were used as part of the\\
password for the sunglasses.\\
==== 1040300 ====
Is this some kind of shutter?\\
==== 1040301 ====
Looks like it. There are some lines on it.\\
==== 1040302 ====
You can use the slider over here to zoom in\\
and out.\\
==== 1040400 ====
The view on this monitor can be zoomed in\\
and out... Time to try again.\\
==== 1040500 ====
The monitor view can zoom in and out...\\
==== 1040501 ====
Some kind of hint maybe? Let's keep it in\\
mind.\\
==== 1040600 ====
The monitor's displaying some lines on the\\
shutter... What is that hinting?\\
==== 1040700 ====
These lines were the hint to the angles for\\
the laser device's knobs.\\
==== 1040800 ====
The top right monitors aren't showing\\
anything...\\
==== 1040801 ====
They're totally black. How do we turn them\\
on?\\
==== 1040900 ====
All three monitors are black.\\
==== 1041000 ====
These three monitors here have a letter each\\
on them.\\
==== 1041001 ====
From left to right they read T, Y, and E. I\\
wonder what this means?\\
==== 1041100 ====
The monitors here are displaying the letters\\
T, Y, and E.\\
==== 1041200 ====
These letters were part of the password for\\
the sunglasses.\\
==== 1050300 ====
Are those...cylinders on the monitor?\\
==== 1050301 ====
That's my guess. But I don't recognize them.\\
Maybe they're from one of the other wards.\\
==== 1050400 ====
This monitor shows a room with a bunch of\\
cylinders in rows.\\
==== 1050500 ====
Whoa, this room looks totally different when\\
the light is off.\\
==== 1050501 ====
You're right. And some of those cylinders lit\\
up, too.\\
==== 1050600 ====
Glowing cylinders... That must mean\\
something.\\
==== 1050601 ====
Eight of the twelve are lit up.\\
==== 1050602 ====
Hmm, twelve... Is there something similar in\\
this room?\\
==== 1050700 ====
The twelve cylinders are hinting at the\\
buttons over on that other device.\\
==== 1060100 ====
The four monitors here are turned off.\\
==== 1060101 ====
They can only be seen by those pure of heart.\\
==== 1060102 ====
What, really?\\
==== 1060103 ====
I'm kidding. Too gullible, man.\\
==== 1060200 ====
Nothing's on these four monitors, regardless\\
of the purity of who's looking.\\
==== 1060300 ====
Some letters showed up on the monitors.\\
==== 1060301 ====
From top to bottom they read B, D, T, and I.\\
==== 1060400 ====
These four monitors are displaying B, D, T,\\
and I from top to bottom.\\
==== 1060500 ====
These letters were used for the password for\\
the sunglasses.\\
==== 1070100 ====
This looks like a switchboard. It has the\\
painful shock sign on it.\\
==== 1070101 ====
Painful shock?\\
==== 1070102 ====
The yellow mark over in the corner.\\
==== 1070103 ====
Oh, I see it. That sign indicates high voltage.\\
==== 1070104 ====
You always were scared of static shocks\\
during winter, weren't you, Akane?\\
==== 1070105 ====
I also make sure to not pull plugs out with wet\\
hands. A shock from that terrifies me.\\
==== 1070106 ====
Ha ha. You're probably afraid of thunder too,\\
aren't you?\\
==== 1070200 ====
A switchboard. The painâ€“I mean, voltage\\
sign is in the top right corner.\\
==== 1070201 ====
Anyway, let's see if we can connect the\\
cords.\\
==== 1070300 ====
Huh? Did it just...\\
==== 1070301 ====
Check out the top left monitor! The door on\\
the screen opened!\\
==== 1070302 ====
And we didn't even have to work for it. What\\
great luck.\\
==== 1070400 ====
Huh. I think that did it?\\
==== 1070401 ====
Seems so. The door on the top left monitor is\\
open now.\\
==== 1070402 ====
So the poster and the sunglasses were the\\
hints for this after all.\\
==== 1070500 ====
Nothing's happening... Is there a right way to\\
do this?\\
==== 1070600 ====
Still wrong... We should see if there's a clue\\
for the right arrangement.\\
==== 1070601 ====
That shock mark might be a hint?\\
==== 1070602 ====
We should probably call it the voltage sign...\\
But you're right. Let's take note of it.\\
==== 1070700 ====
Oh? What did I do wrong?\\
==== 1070701 ====
We saw that voltage sign somewhere else,\\
didn't we? Let's check it again.\\
==== 1070800 ====
Damn, still wrong.\\
==== 1070801 ====
Wasn't there a mark on the poster, and in A\\
mode in the sunglasses?\\
==== 1070802 ====
He's on to something. The same mark keeps\\
appearing. It must be some kind of clue.\\
==== 1070900 ====
Connecting the cords only opened that\\
monitor door in the end.\\
==== 1070901 ====
I'd hoped it would somehow connect to the\\
outside world... That's too bad.\\
==== 1071000 ====
What's this card?\\
==== 1071001 ====
Some of the boxes have numbers written in\\
them.\\
==== 1071002 ====
Gotta be some kind of hint. Let's take it with\\
us.\\
==== 1080100 ====
Huh? I think this speaker can be slid to the\\
side.\\
==== 1080101 ====
What? Let's do it!\\
==== 1080102 ====
Huh. There's a depression here...and what's\\
this?\\
==== 1080103 ====
It's a card with boxes and numbers.\\
==== 1080104 ====
It was hidden, so it's probably useful. Let's\\
take it just in case.\\
==== 1080200 ====
There's nothing left behind the speaker.\\
==== 1080201 ====
A monster might bite your hand if you stuck it\\
in far enough.\\
==== 1080202 ====
What are you even saying, Junpei. As if that\\
would happen...\\
==== 1080203 ====
Your voice is wobbly and you're shaking like a\\
leaf, Akane...\\
==== 1080300 ====
Nothing's behind the speaker. Not even a\\
monster, as far as I can tell.\\
==== 1090100 ====
What is this machine for?\\
==== 1090101 ====
No clue. Looks like it's connected to the one\\
on the right, too.\\
==== 1090102 ====
I see a loose cable sticking out. I'm not sure\\
what it's for.\\
==== 1090200 ====
It's a strange machine connected to the one\\
next to it. A cable is sticking out of it.\\
==== 1090300 ====
What is this big cable for?\\
==== 1090301 ====
Well, let's see. Maybe holding it up to your\\
mouth will shoot cola out?\\
==== 1090302 ====
The hell it will. ...Kids would flip if that really\\
did happen though.\\
==== 1090400 ====
The cable coming out of the machine on the\\
left. Where can we plug it in...\\
==== 1090500 ====
Where are we supposed to plug this in again?\\
==== 1090501 ====
The video showed an outlet for it, but it's\\
still under the floor.\\
==== 1090502 ====
I think if we match the direction of the\\
stands, the floor will open up?\\
==== 1090600 ====
Going by the video, we need to turn the\\
stands, then plug the cable into the machine.\\
==== 1090700 ====
I get the feeling this cable will fit in that hole\\
on the machine. Should we try?\\
==== 1090701 ====
Yeah, let's do it.\\
==== 1090800 ====
I'm plugging this cable into the machine. You\\
ready?\\
==== 1090801 ====
Yes. No need to hesitate!\\
==== 1090802 ====
Just do it already, Carlos.\\
==== 1090900 ====
What's this huge machine for?\\
==== 1090901 ====
I've never seen it before. I have no idea how\\
to use it either.\\
==== 1090902 ====
Then we probably shouldnâ€™t touch it. Who\\
knows what could happen.\\
==== 1091000 ====
A huge machine. Purpose unknown. It's best\\
not to touch it.\\
==== 1100100 ====
Huh. This door down here is locked.\\
==== 1100101 ====
I wonder what could be in here. Is there any\\
way to open it?\\
==== 1100102 ====
I'm not sure. Let's look around.\\
==== 1100200 ====
The door in the floor. It's locked.\\
==== 1100300 ====
This door in the floor won't open... What do\\
we do?\\
==== 1100301 ====
Maybe we need to do what was shown in the\\
video on the sunglasses?\\
==== 1100400 ====
If we do what we saw in the video, we need to\\
rotate the stands and match the angle.\\
==== 1100500 ====
Oh... I think this hole can fit something in it.\\
==== 1100501 ====
Maybe we need to connect something to it.\\
But what?\\
==== 1100600 ====
This looks like a hole for connecting\\
something.\\
==== 1100700 ====
Well...the door in the floor is unlocked. What\\
next?\\
==== 1100701 ====
Uh, maybe...\\
==== 1100702 ====
Let's watch the video on the sunglasses\\
again.\\
==== 1100800 ====
According to the video, we need to plug the\\
cable into the hole.\\
==== 1100801 ====
The cable's nearby, so let's do this.\\
==== 1110100 ====
A bunch of knobs with mirrors on the edges...\\
What in the world is this machine?\\
==== 1110101 ====
I'm not really sure, but why don't we try\\
turning some of them?\\
==== 1110102 ====
Yeah, as if doing random things will actually\\
get us anywhere.\\
==== 1110200 ====
A machine with several mirrored knobs.\\
==== 1110300 ====
You know, I think I've seen the layout for\\
these knobs somewhere before...\\
==== 1110301 ====
Yeah, me too... But where?\\
==== 1110400 ====
...Doesn't this layout seem to match what's\\
showing on the top right monitor?\\
==== 1110401 ====
Yeah. Zoomed out, those lines were arranged\\
exactly where the knobs are.\\
==== 1110402 ====
We need to match the angles then?\\
==== 1110500 ====
Hey look. The locker on the bottom opened\\
up.\\
==== 1110501 ====
So turning the knobs was the key...\\
==== 1110502 ====
I kind of can't believe we got the angles right\\
by just guessing.\\
==== 1110600 ====
Oh... It seems like we were right.\\
==== 1110601 ====
So the monitor WAS the hint for this after all.\\
==== 1110602 ====
Bottom locker's open. Let's see what's in it.\\
==== 1110700 ====
The laser started automatically once we had\\
the knob angles correct.\\
==== 1110701 ====
It was so sudden that it startled me.\\
==== 1110702 ====
Ah, well, we cleared this puzzle, so let's see\\
what's inside the locker.\\
==== 1110800 ====
We've checked everything out on this\\
machine already. Let's keep looking around.\\
==== 1110900 ====
We can turn these knobs left and right.\\
==== 1110901 ====
Reminds me of closing a gas valve.\\
==== 1110902 ====
I can just picture Junpei forgetting to close\\
it, and panicking once the room smells of gas.\\
==== 1110903 ====
You, on the other hand, would probably never\\
make a mistake like that.\\
==== 1111000 ====
Let's turn this knob.\\
==== 1111100 ====
We've already figured out the trick to this,\\
so we don't need to do anything anymore.\\
==== 1111200 ====
I can't open this locker down here.\\
==== 1111201 ====
If it's locked, then there's probably a way to\\
unlock it.\\
==== 1111202 ====
But how are we going to do that...\\
==== 1111300 ====
The locker attached to this machine. It's\\
locked.\\
==== 1111400 ====
So what's in here?\\
==== 1111401 ====
A small battery... Maybe it attaches to\\
something? And this is...\\
==== 1111402 ====
A card with some numbers on it...\\
==== 1111500 ====
There's nothing else in this locker. No point\\
to staring at it anymore.\\
==== 1111600 ====
Hey, there's a monitor here.\\
==== 1111601 ====
But it's blank.\\
==== 1111602 ====
Maybe it'll show instructions for this machine\\
if we push a button somewhere.\\
==== 1111700 ====
The laser's been activated, but there's still\\
nothing showing on the monitor.\\
==== 1111800 ====
These look like some input buttons...\\
==== 1111801 ====
Nope, nothing happens when you push them.\\
==== 1111802 ====
Maybe we need to push something somewhere\\
else?\\
==== 1111900 ====
Nothing happens when you push the buttons...\\
Let's look somewhere else.\\
==== 1120100 ====
This machine measures amounts of radiation.\\
It's called a radiation meter.\\
==== 1120101 ====
There's that firefighter side coming out.\\
==== 1120102 ====
There are a bunch of large buttons down\\
here. Twelve in all.\\
==== 1120200 ====
A radiation meter. There are 12 large buttons\\
at the bottom right.\\
==== 1120300 ====
Didn't we see this button layout before?\\
==== 1120301 ====
Yeah, you're right... But where?\\
==== 1120400 ====
Hey, doesn't this layout look a lot like what's\\
on the bottom right monitor?\\
==== 1120401 ====
Ah, yes! The cylinders! There are twelve of\\
them too!\\
==== 1120402 ====
If they're connected, then we have to push\\
the buttons that match the lit cylinders.\\
==== 1120500 ====
Oh, the locker at the bottom left of this just\\
unlocked!\\
==== 1120501 ====
I don't believe it... I just used my gut and\\
started pushing buttons.\\
==== 1120502 ====
The correct answer just appeared in his\\
head... That happened to me a year ago.\\
==== 1120503 ====
Heh, no, just a coincidence... No way Carlos\\
can do that, too.\\
==== 1120600 ====
Yes! We got it right. The bottom left locker is\\
open now.\\
==== 1120601 ====
So the hint really was the lit cylinders.\\
==== 1120602 ====
I'm more curious about the locker. Why don't\\
we take a look.\\
==== 1120700 ====
Pressing the correct buttons caused the\\
bottom left locker to open.\\
==== 1120701 ====
Yeah, and I bet there's some kind of reward.\\
==== 1120702 ====
I'm going to laugh if it's only full of candy.\\
Okay, here we go.\\
==== 1120800 ====
We've already checked everything on this.\\
Time to search somewhere else.\\
==== 1120900 ====
I see... Touching a button will turn the light\\
on and off.\\
==== 1120901 ====
Then they're all just on/off switches.\\
==== 1120902 ====
If only Junpei's personality changed as\\
easily.\\
==== 1120903 ====
What, the me before and the me now? Not\\
likely.\\
==== 1120904 ====
The amount of things I know now that I didn't\\
then... It's too big a difference.\\
==== 1120905 ====
Junpei...\\
==== 1121000 ====
Time to mash some buttons.\\
==== 1121100 ====
We don't need to mess with the buttons again\\
since we got the right answer.\\
==== 1121200 ====
This locker is locked. We can't open it.\\
==== 1121201 ====
It just deepens the mystery. Is there any trick\\
to opening it up?\\
==== 1121300 ====
This locker can't be opened. There has to be\\
something we can do to unlock it.\\
==== 1121400 ====
Let's see what's in this locker.\\
==== 1121401 ====
Some kind of ear speaker...and this.\\
==== 1121402 ====
A card with four numbers on it...\\
==== 1121500 ====
Nothing else in the locker.\\
==== 1121600 ====
What's this meter?\\
==== 1121601 ====
It must be for measuring radiation levels.\\
==== 1121602 ====
But the needle isn't moving. Maybe we have\\
to do something on this machine first.\\
==== 1121700 ====
The needle's still not moving... I guess Zero\\
must've fixed it in place.\\
==== 1130100 ====
...I think this poster can come up.\\
==== 1130101 ====
Okay then, let's make like we're flipping up a\\
girl's skirt!\\
==== 1130102 ====
Oh, sunglasses! There are sunglasses behind\\
this!\\
==== 1130103 ====
Ha, so there IS treasure from flipping things\\
up!\\
==== 1130200 ====
I wonder what these two columns of numbers\\
mean.\\
==== 1130201 ====
Notice that there's a voltage sign in the top\\
right as well.\\
==== 1130202 ====
It's not as if the poster has electricity\\
running through it, so why is it there?\\
==== 1130300 ====
There are two columns of numbers and a\\
voltage sign on the poster.\\
==== 1130400 ====
The columns and the voltage sign... Why do\\
they seem so...?\\
==== 1130401 ====
Hey, didn't we just see that mark\\
somewhere?\\
==== 1130500 ====
Two columns of numbers... A voltage sign in\\
the corner...\\
==== 1130501 ====
We saw that mark in the video on the\\
sunglasses as well.\\
==== 1130502 ====
Does that mean they're all related?\\
==== 1130600 ====
This was the hint for how to connect the\\
switchboard.\\
==== 1140100 ====
There's a total of ten lockers.\\
==== 1140101 ====
We tried them all, but none open.\\
==== 1140102 ====
I want to know what's inside. But no point to\\
wishing since they're locked.\\
==== 1140200 ====
Ten lockers lined up. All locked.\\
==== 1150100 ====
This is a sturdy door.\\
==== 1150101 ====
We couldn't force it open, so I'm guessing it's\\
impossible to break it down too.\\
==== 1150102 ====
Let's try to find a way out.\\
==== 1150200 ====
It's a strong door. No way we can force it\\
open.\\
==== 1160100 ====
Look, is the center of this stand pointing at a\\
direction?\\
==== 1160101 ====
It seems so. But what does it mean...\\
==== 1160102 ====
Oh hey, we can turn it. Let's fiddle with it.\\
==== 1160200 ====
Okay, let's turn this stand.\\
==== 1160300 ====
This stand came out of the floor.\\
==== 1160301 ====
We should turn this one, too.\\
==== 1160400 ====
Oh?! A black stand just came out of the floor!\\
==== 1160401 ====
Did we get the directions right on accident?\\
==== 1160402 ====
Oh! Look at the bottom right monitor! The\\
light in that room turned off!\\
==== 1160500 ====
Huh? A black stand came out of the floor?\\
==== 1160501 ====
Does that mean we got the directions right?\\
==== 1160502 ====
The light in the room on the bottom right\\
monitor also turned off.\\
==== 1160600 ====
Oh... The floor opened and something came\\
out.\\
==== 1160601 ====
This is just a guess, but I think we somehow\\
got it right with our random turning.\\
==== 1160602 ====
Hey, we got lucky. Let's just be thankful.\\
==== 1160700 ====
So turning the stands according to the\\
instructions on the video brings that out.\\
==== 1160701 ====
I hope it was worth the hard work.\\
==== 1160800 ====
No need to turn this anymore.\\
==== 1170100 ====
What is this machine?\\
==== 1170101 ====
No idea. I've never seen it before... Why\\
don't we try pushing some buttons.\\
==== 1170102 ====
No dice. Is this thing broken?\\
==== 1170200 ====
I've never seen this machine before, but it's\\
not doing anything so it must be broken.\\
==== 1180100 ====
...This looks like your standard carbon\\
dioxide extinguisher.\\
==== 1180101 ====
I can definitely tell you're a firefighter.\\
You're not missing a thing.\\
==== 1180102 ====
Really? I'm getting a crick in my neck just\\
trying to look at the ceiling.\\
==== 1180200 ====
There's nothing strange or unusual about the\\
extinguisher. Let's keep looking around.\\
==== 1190100 ====
Guurrrrrr\\
==== 1190200 ====
Znnnuurr\\
==== 1190300 ====
Vrrrreeee\\
==== 1190400 ====
Whirrrrrr\\
==== 1190500 ====
Ding dong\\
==== 2010100 ====
Some sunglasses we found behind the poster.\\
But the earpieces are missing.\\
==== 2010101 ====
These are vital when it's summer and the sun\\
is bright. Not so much in the winter, like now.\\
==== 2010102 ====
I've always liked them since I was a kid.\\
Doesn't it seem like they make you look cool?\\
==== 2010103 ====
Yeah, just like in that movie with The One\\
fighting against the computer AI. Classic.\\
==== 2010104 ====
I have to say Iâ€™m surprised you know that old\\
movie. It's one of my favorites.\\
==== 2010200 ====
A pair of sunglasses without earpieces.\\
==== 2020100 ====
If you look close, you can see a terminal point\\
on the end.\\
==== 2020101 ====
It also looks like an earpiece.\\
==== 2020102 ====
It must attach to a pair of glasses. Maybe we\\
can use it somewhere.\\
==== 2020200 ====
A small battery that looks like an earpiece\\
for glasses with a spot to attach it.\\
==== 2030100 ====
We found the ear speaker in the radiation\\
meter's locker.\\
==== 2030101 ====
It looks like the type that goes over your ear.\\
==== 2030102 ====
Maybe it's supposed to attach to a pair of\\
glasses.\\
==== 2030200 ====
It looks like an ear speaker for glasses.\\
==== 2040100 ====
What? The sunglasses are displaying\\
something on the lenses.\\
==== 2040101 ====
Then attaching the battery turned them on?\\
Must not be normal sunglasses.\\
==== 2040102 ====
Yeah. Looks like there are three modes: A, B,\\
and C. We should pick one.\\
==== 2040103 ====
Select a viewing mode\\
==== 2040104 ====
A mode\\
==== 2040105 ====
B mode\\
==== 2040106 ====
C mode\\
==== 2040200 ====
The mode selection screen. Okay, which\\
one...\\
==== 2040201 ====
Select a viewing mode\\
==== 2040202 ====
A mode\\
==== 2040203 ====
B mode\\
==== 2040204 ====
C mode\\
==== 2040300 ====
Okay, let's go to A mode.\\
==== 2040301 ====
What was that? A bunch of scribbled lines?\\
==== 2040302 ====
No wait... I think there was a mark in the top\\
right corner.\\
==== 2040400 ====
...Let's watch A mode again.\\
==== 2040401 ====
Still scribbled lines...\\
==== 2040402 ====
Maybe that voltage sign at the top right is\\
some kind of clue.\\
==== 2040500 ====
Let's watch A mode's video.\\
==== 2040501 ====
That was the hint for connecting the\\
switchboard.\\
==== 2040600 ====
Okay, let's go with B mode.\\
==== 2040601 ====
Huh? It's just showing numbers changing on\\
a wall... I'm not sure what that means.\\
==== 2040700 ====
B mode time.\\
==== 2040701 ====
The number's switching from 1 to 4, and the\\
background is changing too.\\
==== 2040800 ====
All right, let's try C mode.\\
==== 2040900 ====
Let's change it to C mode again.\\
==== 2041000 ====
What?! I didn't think my random password\\
guess would work...\\
==== 2041001 ====
Oh, a video is playing...\\
==== 2041002 ====
Was that Zero? But...what does it mean?\\
==== 2041100 ====
Yes! It was the correct password.\\
==== 2041101 ====
Now there's a video...\\
==== 2041102 ====
Was that Zero? But...what does it mean?\\
==== 2041200 ====
We won't get some kind of video to play\\
without the password, but what do we put in?\\
==== 2041300 ====
No use... There's no way to get a 14 letter\\
password right by inputting at random.\\
==== 2041400 ====
This is wrong, too... But I feel like we saw a\\
password like this somewhere...\\
==== 2041500 ====
Fourteen letters... There ARE 14 small\\
monitors on the console.\\
==== 2041501 ====
Maybe the letters in them are connected to\\
the password?\\
==== 2041600 ====
Okay, let's watch C mode's video.\\
==== 2041601 ====
He's...turning the stands in certain\\
directions.\\
==== 2041602 ====
And he plugged the cable into that machine\\
out of the floor?\\
==== 2041700 ====
Let's watch C mode's video.\\
==== 2041701 ====
...Maybe we need to do exact what it's\\
showing.\\
==== 2041702 ====
Match the directions of the stands, and plug\\
the cable into the machine.\\
==== 2041800 ====
Let's see C mode.\\
==== 2041801 ====
We have all the stands moved to match\\
what's in the video.\\
==== 2041802 ====
Now we just have to plug the cable in to the\\
machine...\\
==== 2050100 ====
So, we attached the ear speaker to the\\
sunglasses...\\
==== 2050101 ====
But it's only on one side. The whole thing is\\
off balance.\\
==== 2050102 ====
And we can't hear anything with the speaker.\\
Are we still missing something?\\
==== 2050200 ====
Sunglasses with an ear speaker attached. We\\
can't hear anything from it though.\\
==== 2060100 ====
Wait, what's going on? It's video and sound...\\
==== 2060101 ====
Did the sunglasses become a head-mounted\\
display?\\
==== 2060102 ====
Oh, oh! What's it like, Carlos?!\\
==== 2060103 ====
Hold on a sec... I see three modes: A, B, and\\
C.\\
==== 2060104 ====
Select a viewing mode\\
==== 2060105 ====
A mode\\
==== 2060106 ====
B mode\\
==== 2060107 ====
C mode\\
==== 2060200 ====
Select viewing mode, huh?\\
==== 2060201 ====
Select a viewing mode\\
==== 2060202 ====
A mode\\
==== 2060203 ====
B mode\\
==== 2060204 ====
C mode\\
==== 2060300 ====
Okay, let's check out A mode.\\
==== 2060301 ====
What was that? It's just a bunch of lines.\\
==== 2060302 ====
...I can't hear anything.\\
==== 2060303 ====
And there's a mark up in the top right.\\
==== 2060400 ====
Let's see A mode.\\
==== 2060401 ====
Yup, still scribbled lines.\\
==== 2060402 ====
And there's still no sound. I didn't hear\\
anything.\\
==== 2060403 ====
That was a voltage sign in the top right. Is\\
that a hint to something?\\
==== 2060500 ====
Let's view A mode.\\
==== 2060501 ====
This was the clue to connecting the\\
switchboard.\\
==== 2060600 ====
All right, how about B mode.\\
==== 2060601 ====
I heard different sounds...\\
==== 2060602 ====
And the number on the wall changed as each\\
sound happened.\\
==== 2060700 ====
Let's see B mode.\\
==== 2060701 ====
The number on the wall changes for each\\
sound.\\
==== 2060702 ====
The number goes from 1 to 4, and there are\\
three kinds of sounds... Is this important?\\
==== 2060800 ====
Let's check out B mode.\\
==== 2060801 ====
The number and the sounds were the hint for\\
moving the crane.\\
==== 2060900 ====
All right, how about we try C mode.\\
==== 2061000 ====
Let's do C mode again.\\
==== 2061100 ====
Whoa, what?! That was the password?!\\
==== 2061101 ====
U-Uh, anyway... Let's watch this video.\\
==== 2061102 ====
Was that Zero? But...what does it mean?\\
==== 2061200 ====
As we thought, the 14 letters were the\\
password.\\
==== 2061201 ====
Oh, the video started playing.\\
==== 2061202 ====
Was that Zero? But...what does it mean?\\
==== 2061300 ====
Oh, it needs a password, huh... What should\\
we enter?\\
==== 2061400 ====
Still not working... Well, it IS 14 letters.\\
Random guessing won't work, I guess.\\
==== 2061500 ====
Looks like it's wrong. Fourteen letters...\\
Where have I see something like that before?\\
==== 2061600 ====
Fourteen... That's right, there are 14 small\\
monitors on the console.\\
==== 2061601 ====
Maybe the letters there are related to the\\
password.\\
==== 2061700 ====
Let's watch the video.\\
==== 2061701 ====
He's...turning the stands in certain\\
directions. And then...\\
==== 2061702 ====
He plugged the cable into the machine that\\
came out of the floor. So...\\
==== 2061800 ====
All right, let's watch C mode's video.\\
==== 2061801 ====
...Maybe we have to do what the video\\
shows, and that's how we escape the room?\\
==== 2061802 ====
Match the directions of the stands, and plug\\
the cable into the machine. Right?\\
==== 2061900 ====
Let's double check C mode's video.\\
==== 2061901 ====
The direction of our stands matches the ones\\
in the video.\\
==== 2061902 ====
Now to just plug the cable into the machine...\\
